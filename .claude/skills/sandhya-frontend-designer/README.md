# Claude Design Skill – Usage Guide

## What this is

A dual‑mode design skill that keeps UI work both:

* Enterprise‑grade
* Visually distinctive

## Modes

Claude auto‑selects unless you specify:

* **Enterprise Craft Mode** → serious, precise, scalable UI
* **Aesthetic Mode** → expressive, branded, thematic UI

You can override by saying:

> "Use Enterprise Craft Mode" or "Use Aesthetic Mode"

## When it runs

Automatically when you:

* Ask for UI
* Ask for UX flows
* Ask for product surfaces

## Brand usage

If you want branding, provide:

* Color palette
* Optional typography preferences

Example:

> "Use this palette: #1E3A8A, #F97316, #E5E7EB"

## Design direction

Claude will ask for design direction only when:

* A new screen
* A new product surface

## Motion preference

All animations are:

* Creative
* Fast
* Purposeful

## Philosophy

Flow → Purpose → Craft → Style

Design starts with meaning, not visuals.
