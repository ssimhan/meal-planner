**Why This Matters:**
[Why was this phase necessary? What foundation did it create?]

**Key Learning:**
[What did you learn that informed later phases?]

---

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Commit:** `[git-hash]` - [Commit message]

**What We Built:**
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]

**The Challenge:**
[What problem did this phase solve?]

**The Solution:**
[How did you approach it?]

**Key Learning:**
[What insight emerged?]

---

### Phase 2: [Phase Name - Critical Pivot]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Commit:** `[git-hash]` - [Commit message]

**The Crisis:**
[What wasn't working? What prompted the change?]

## Evolution Summary

### Stage 1: Manual Process
[How things worked before automation]
- **Problems:** [What didn't work well?]

### Stage 2: Basic Automation
[First automation attempts]
- **Achievement:** [What improved?]

### Stage 3: Refinement Based on Use
[Improvements from real-world usage]
- **Achievement:** [What made it sustainable?]

**Overall Arc:**
[How did the project evolve? Why incremental beats big-bang?]

*Pattern from meal-planner: Weeks 1-3 manual → Week 4 basic automation → Week 8 farmers market integration → Week 12 energy-based refinement. Each phase built on learnings from actual use.*

## Lessons Learned

### For Technical Implementation

1. **[Lesson Title]**
   [Description with concrete example from your project]

2. **[Lesson Title]**
   [Description with example]

### For Working with Claude Code

1. **Specific instructions > Vague goals**
   Example: "No recipe from last 3 weeks" works better than "keep it varied"

2. **Validation checklists catch errors early**
   Example: Running through checklist before finalizing prevents invalid outputs

3. **[Your lesson]**
   [Your example]

### For Project Management

1. **Document decisions when you make them**
   6 months later you'll forget why you chose approach X over Y

2. **Use it before automating it**
   Manual process reveals actual pain points vs imagined ones

3. **[Your lesson]**
   [Your example]

## Metrics of Success

How do you know this project works?

1. **[Metric 1]** - [e.g., "Reduced time from 2 hours to 5 minutes"]
2. **[Metric 2]** - [e.g., "Zero errors in last 20 uses"]
3. **[Metric 3]** - [e.g., "Used consistently for X weeks"]
4. **[Metric 4]** - [e.g., "Eliminated decision fatigue around X"]

*Pattern from meal-planner: Metrics were qualitative (reduced evening stress, eliminated decision paralysis) not just quantitative (time saved).*

---

## Future Improvements (Maybe)

Things to consider if the need becomes clear:

- [ ] [Potential enhancement 1]
- [ ] [Potential enhancement 2]
- [ ] [Potential enhancement 3]

**Note:** Don't build these until real usage shows they're needed!

*Pattern from meal-planner: "Future Features" section in README tracked possibilities. Most weren't needed; a few became critical based on real use.*
