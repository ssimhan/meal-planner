## Visual Style

**Core Style:** Playful Illustrated Minimalism — Modular Building Blocks Aesthetic

**Signature Visual Approach:**
The core visual identity uses a **hybrid modular approach** that adapts based on the concept being taught:
- **Network layouts** (modular blocks) for architectural/structural concepts — showing how systems are compositions of parts
- **Linear flow layouts** for process/transformation concepts — showing how inputs become outputs
- **Primarily rounded rectangles** as the signature shape, with occasional circles or other forms when they better represent specific concepts

**Key Visual Elements:**
- **Rounded rectangular modules** as the primary shape language — clean edges with subtle hand-drawn character
- **Simple interior icons** — gears, database cylinders, people, lightbulbs, clouds — sketched in a friendly style
- **Occasional circles or varied shapes** for inputs/outputs or when concept demands it (flexibility within consistency)
- **Connection points** shown as circles or squares at block edges, indicating how modules plug together
- **Dotted/dashed lines** suggesting relationships and potential connections
- **Flexible layouts** — network constellation for structure, linear flow for processes
- **Warm color coding** — teal blocks as primary, mustard yellow and coral as accents for different module types
- **Text labels included** — concept title and explanatory subtitle in teal and mustard typography

**Overall Characteristics:**
- Simple, clean layouts with generous breathing room
- Hand-drawn or illustrated elements that feel human and approachable
- Visual metaphors that make complex ideas delightful (systems = building with blocks)
- One clear focal point per image — easy to grasp at a glance
- Sketch-like quality that feels authentic, not overly polished
- Think: "whiteboard explanation that sparks joy" meets "LEGO instruction manual"

**Emotional Tone:**
- Playful and creative — learning should be fun
- Warm and inviting — like a friendly expert sketching ideas for you
- Approachable and human — not corporate or stuffy
- Subtly clever — rewards attention without being show-offy
- Encouraging — "you can understand this" energy

## Design Elements

### Illustration Style
- **Hand-drawn feel:** Slightly imperfect lines, human touch
- **Simple line art:** Clear, uncluttered sketches
- **Friendly characters/objects:** Give concepts personality (anthropomorphize when helpful)
- **Doodle accents:** Small decorative elements (arrows, stars, underlines, dots)
- **Whiteboard aesthetic:** Like you're explaining something live

### Layout
- Clean, uncluttered compositions with ONE main idea
- Generous whitespace — let the illustration breathe
- Asymmetrical balance (not rigid grids)
- Leave appropriate room for text overlays
- Visual hierarchy through size and placement, not complexity

### Shapes & Forms
- **Primary:** Rounded rectangles (signature modular block shape)
- **Secondary:** Circles for inputs/outputs or data concepts when appropriate
- **Approach:** Mostly unified with occasional variety for conceptual clarity
- **Line quality:** Clean with hand-drawn touches — defined shapes with subtle warmth, not overly wobbly
- **Edge style:** Soft rounded corners, gentle imperfection without being messy
- Avoid hard angles and overly geometric precision

### Tech Representation (Subtle & Metaphorical)
- **Primary approach:** Modular building blocks — rounded rectangles with simple icons inside, showing how independent components snap together into systems
- **Avoid:** Literal circuits, code snippets, sci-fi imagery, corporate diagrams
- **Instead use:**
  - **Building blocks/modules (PRIMARY)** — hand-drawn rounded rectangles with connection points and simple interior icons (gears, databases, people, clouds, etc.)
  - Puzzle pieces connecting (for integration concepts)
  - Simple flowcharts with personality (arrows with expressions?)
  - Abstract networks shown as constellations or web patterns
  - Lightbulbs, thought bubbles, speech balloons
  - Books, notebooks, sketched diagrams
  - Anthropomorphized objects teaching each other

**Block Module Guidelines:**
- Rounded corners (soft, friendly)
- Clean edges with subtle hand-drawn character (defined but warm, not overly wobbly)
- Simple icons inside (one concept per block)
- Connection points visible (circles/squares at edges)
- Color coding intentional (teal = core, yellow/coral = accents)
- Layout adapts to concept:
  - **Network/constellation** for architectural/structural topics (composability)
  - **Linear flow** for process/transformation topics (input → output)
- Dotted/dashed lines showing connections and relationships
- Include text labels: concept title and explanatory subtitle using teal and mustard typography

### Visual Effects
- Minimal effects — let the illustration do the work
- Soft drop shadows only when needed for depth
- Subtle textures (paper, canvas) to enhance hand-drawn feel
- No gradients unless illustrating a concept (like a spectrum)
- Color fills can be flat or slightly textured

## Content-Based Visual Strategies

### Systems/Architecture Topics
- **Visual metaphor:** Modular building blocks with connection points (PRIMARY) — rounded rectangles snapping together
- **Layout choice:**
  - **Network constellation** for structural concepts (how components relate and compose)
  - **Linear flow** for process concepts (how data/requests move through system layers)
- **Style:** Clean modules with subtle hand-drawn character, simple interior icons, dotted connection lines
- **Example:** 4-6 rounded rectangular blocks with icons (gear, database, person, cloud) and visible connection points (circles/squares at edges). Network layout for architecture diagrams, linear flow for data pipelines. Teal primary blocks with mustard yellow and coral accent blocks.
- **Text labels:** Include concept title (e.g., "BUILDING BLOCKS OF THOUGHT") and subtitle in teal/mustard
- **Key details:** Clean edges with warmth, simple one-icon-per-block rule, clear connection points, warm color coding, appropriate layout for concept

### AI/ML Topics
- **Visual metaphor:** Teaching/learning scenes, brain with thought bubbles, friendly robots learning
- **Style:** Illustrated teacher-student dynamics, lightbulbs lighting up, decision trees as actual trees
- **Example:** Cute robot reading a book, neural pathways drawn as garden paths with ideas growing

### Code/Engineering Topics
- **Visual metaphor:** Workshop/toolbox imagery, recipe cards, instruction manuals
- **Style:** Hand-drawn tools, friendly code blocks with personality, construction metaphors
- **Example:** A toolbox spilling out illustrated tools, or a recipe being followed step-by-step

### Learning/Teaching Topics
- **Visual metaphor:** Journey maps, lightbulb moments, staircase/ladder of progress
- **Style:** Illustrated paths with landmarks, friendly guides pointing the way
- **Example:** Character climbing steps with checkpoints, or map with "you are here" marker

### Concept Explanations
- **Visual metaphor:** Before/after, problem/solution, zooming in/out
- **Style:** Split screens, speech bubbles explaining, magnifying glass on details
- **Example:** Two friendly characters discussing (one confused, one explaining with gestures)

### Abstract/Complex Topics
- **Visual metaphor:** Containers and contents, networks as webs or constellations, layers as transparent sheets
- **Style:** Simple shapes with labels, friendly abstractions with personality
- **Example:** Ideas flowing between containers, constellation connecting concepts with dotted lines

## Brand Consistency Principles

**All branded content should:**
- Use the same color palette (teal primary with consistent accent pops)
- Follow the same visual style (playful illustrated minimalism)
- Have the same hand-drawn, human quality (imperfect is perfect)
- Maintain the same emotional tone (playful, warm, encouraging)
- Feel like they belong to the same visual family (same illustrator drew them all)

**Always prioritize:**
- Clarity over complexity — ONE main idea per image
- Playfulness over perfection — human touch beats polish
- Metaphor over literalism — show the concept, not the code
- Warmth over coolness — inviting, not sterile
- Simplicity over detail — less is more delightful
- Intentional color use (teal anchors, accents add joy sparingly)
- Generous whitespace (let it breathe!)
- Accessibility and readability

**The "Would I Sketch This?" Test:**
Before finalizing any visual, ask: "Would I draw this on a whiteboard to explain it to a friend?"
- If yes → you're on brand
- If no → simplify or rethink the metaphor
