## Guidelines

### When to Add to Active Bugs
- Functionality broken or regressed
- Error messages in console
- Data not saving/loading correctly
- UI rendering incorrectly
- **Add immediately when discovered** (don't defer)

### When to Add to Features
- New functionality requests
- Improvements to existing logic
- Refactoring tasks (formerly tech debt)
- UI polish items
- **Add when identifying a need that isn't a bug**

### Priority Levels
- **Critical:** Data loss, crashes, core functionality broken
- **High:** Significant UX impact, workaround exists
- **Medium:** Minor UX issue, edge case
- **Low:** Cosmetic, nice-to-have

### Impact Levels (Features)
- **High:** Critical for user value or developer velocity
- **Medium:** Standard enhancement
- **Low:** Nice-to-have, can be deferred

### Effort Estimates
- **15min:** Quick fix
- **1hr:** Straightforward refactor
- **2-4hrs:** Moderate complexity
- **8hrs+:** Major refactor (consider breaking into smaller items)

## AI Assistant Notes

**During development sessions:**
1. Scan for TODOs/FIXMEs in modified files
2. Flag copy-pasted code patterns
3. Remind about zero-debt policy before phase completion
4. Help triage priority/impact levels

**Before phase completion:**
- Verify both tables are empty (for current phase items)
- Block merge to main if bugs remain
- Suggest de-scoping features if needed to hit quality gate
