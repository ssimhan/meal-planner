# Meal Planner Implementation Guide

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-13
**Live Site:** [meal-planner-eta-seven.vercel.app](https://meal-planner-eta-seven.vercel.app/)

---

> **Workflow Rule:** 
> 1. **Phase = One Branch:** Every phase belongs in a single dedicated branch (e.g. `phase-22-ux-redesign`) until fully complete.
> 2. **Block/Chunk Workflow:** Code -> Test Locally -> Push to Branch (Vercel Preview) -> Manual Verification on Vercel.
> 3. **Merge to Main:** ONLY merge to `main` when the *entire phase* is 100% complete and verified.

## System Overview

Hybrid Serverless application for weekly meal planning, daily execution tracking, and inventory management. Python logic engine + Next.js frontend.

### Core Workflow

1. **Weekly Planning:** "Start New Week" → enter farmers market purchases → "Generate Weekly Plan"
2. **Daily Execution:** View "Today's Schedule" → one-tap logging for meals/prep tasks
3. **Inventory:** Update via "Quick Add" or "Brain Dump"
4. **Confirmation-Driven Fixes:** When normalization or prep-step ambiguity arises, system asks user, records decision, and updates implementation plan for permanent resolution.

### Data Files

- **history.yml:** Source of truth for all past plans and execution data
- **inventory.yml:** Freezer/Fridge/Pantry stock (maintains ≥3 freezer backup meals)
- **recipes/:** YAML recipe files with metadata
- **config.yml:** All user settings (dietary preferences, schedules, kid profiles)

---

## Key Features

### Energy-Based Prep Schedule
Declining energy model: Monday (high) → Friday (zero prep)

- **Monday PM:** Chop Mon/Tue/Wed veg, batch cook components, prep freezer meals (2x, freeze half)
- **Tuesday AM/PM:** Lunch prep for Wed/Thu/Fri, chop Thu/Fri dinner veg
- **Wednesday PM:** Finish ALL remaining prep (no chopping after this)
- **Thursday Morning:** Light assembly only (8-9am), NO chopping after noon, NO evening prep
- **Friday:** Zero prep - reheating/assembly only, dinner must be `no_chop_compatible: true`

### Smart Personalization
- Kid profiles in `config.yml` with individual allergies
- School snacks automatically nut-free
- Leftover pipelines: dinner → next day lunch for family

### Architecture
- **Frontend:** Next.js dashboard (`src/app`)
- **Backend:** Python Serverless Functions (`api/`)
- **Persistence:** GitOps model (all changes committed to GitHub)
- **Plans:** Static HTML (`public/plans/`) with 9 tabs

## Local Development

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh  # Auto-regenerates plans on file changes
```

---

## Development Status

**Current State:** Stable Phase 23.5 Baseline (`stable-phase-23-5` tag). Incremental refactoring in progress.

**Completed Phases:**
- **1-9:** Foundation (recipe parsing, CLI, energy-based prep, HTML plans)
- **10-11:** Logging, performance, inventory intelligence, analytics
- **12:** Architecture refactoring, TypeScript migration, testing
- **13.1-13.4:** State fixes, inventory UX, prep workflow, white-labeling
- **14:** Data Layer Redesign (Plan vs Actual separation)
- **15:** Database Migration (Supabase integration)
- **16:** Smart Weekly Planning Workflow (End-to-End)
- **17:** Core Stability & Data Hygiene
- **18:** Enhanced Planning Workflow (Wizard 2.0)
- **19:** Recipe Ecosystem & UX Polish
- **20:** Advanced Planning Control (Selective Replanning, Confirm Today)
- **21:** Inventory UI/UX Overhaul (Visuals, Move Logic, Dedup)
- **22:** UX Redesign & Feature Parity (Earth Tones theme)
- **23:** Experience Refinement & Personalization
- **23.5:** Household Configuration & UI Polish
- 24 and 25 - original attempt at google oauth and multi-household features. Ended up having big errors and was rolled back.
