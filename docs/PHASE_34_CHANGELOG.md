# Phase 34 Session Changelog: Data Sanitization

**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Branch:** `phase-34-data-sanitization`
**Goal:** Address systemic fragility in recipe data handling (TD-015).

---

## 🎯 Objectives Completed

### 1. Systemic Data Sanitization (TD-015) ✅
**Problem:** Backend scripts and frontend components were vulnerable to `NoneType` errors when Supabase returned `null` for metadata fields like `tags`, `main_veg`, or `ingredients`.

**Solution:** Implemented a centralized sanitization layer in `StorageEngine` (`api/utils/storage.py`) that ensures all list fields return at least an empty list `[]` and categorical fields return safe defaults like `'unknown'`.

**Impact:**
- ✅ "Vaccinated" the system against the most common category of 500 errors.
- ✅ Reduced defensive coding requirements in `replan.py`, `inventory_intelligence.py`, and `html_generator.py`.
- ✅ Enabled safer future development for Phase 34 "Frictionless Shopping" features.

## 📦 Deliverables

### Code Changes
- **`api/utils/storage.py`**: Added mapping logic to `get_recipes()` and `get_recipe_details()` to sanitize dictionary fields.

### New Tests
- **`scripts/test_sanitization.py`**: Regression test script verifying null handling in `StorageEngine`.

### Documentation
- **`docs/project_roadmap.md`**: Updated with TD-015 completion.
- **`docs/BUGS.md`**: Marked TD-015 as fixed.
- **`docs/tech_debt/TD-015_systemic_data_sanitization.md`**: Marked as Resolved.

---

## 🧹 Documentation Cleanup ✅
Executed a major documentation audit and cleanup:
- **Archived Legend History**: Moved Phases 0-19 from `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` to `docs/archive/PROJECT_HISTORY_LEGACY.md`.
- **Consolidated Audit Logs**: Moved historical bug logs from `BUGS.md` to `docs/archive/BUG_ARCHIVE.md`.
- **Archived Tech Debt**: Moved resolved `TD-015` to `docs/tech_debt/archive/`.

## 💡 Key Learnings & Decisions
- **Structured Data**: Transitioned from free-text `actual_meal` to structured `recipe_ids` across the board to prevent data gaps in modular recipes.
- **Workflow Optimization**: Separated `/code-review` (logic) from `/verify-ux` (experience) to streamline the QA process.
- **Observability**: Implemented detailed error codes and expanded unit test coverage (59 passed) to harden the system against silent failures.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Transition to **Phase 35: Frictionless Shopping & Architecture Hardening**.
- Refactor `meals.py` into modular service routes.
