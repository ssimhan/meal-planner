# 🥗 Meal Planner: How to Use

This system automates 90% of the meal planning work. It remembers what you ate, suggests recipes you haven't had in a while, and manages your grocery list.

Here is your weekly routine.

## 📅 The Saturday Routine (5 Minutes)

### 1. Wait for the Notification (5 AM)
Every Saturday morning, the system wakes up and looks for seasonal produce. You will get a notification (via email or GitHub app) that **"Weekly Plan Start"** is ready for review.

### 2. Confirm Vegetables
1.  Click the notification to view the **Pull Request**.
2.  You will see a file listing proposed vegetables (e.g., `spinach`, `carrots`).
3.  **Action:** If you bought something different at the market, edit the file to match reality.
4.  **Action:** Click **"Merge Pull Request"**.

### 3. Done!
The system now takes over:
*   Generates the full weekly menu.
*   Creates your grocery list.
*   Updates the website.

## ✅ The Evening Check-in (8 PM)

Every night at 8 PM, the system asks: *"Did you stick to the plan?"*

1.  Open the notification on your phone (**GitHub App** or **Email**).
2.  You will see a simple checklist:
    - [ ] **Made as planned?** (Yes/No)
    - [ ] **Vegetables used?** (Select from list)
    - [ ] **Kids liked it?** (Love/Like/Meh)
3.  **Click "Comment"** to save.

**Why do this?**
*   If you skip a meal, it remembers to suggest it again soon.
*   It tracks what ingredients you have left in the fridge.
*   It learns which recipes the kids actually eat.

## 🧊 Freezer Backups

The system automatically manages a "Emergency Freezer Stash."
*   **Planned 2x Batches:** Sometimes the plan says *"Make double, freeze half."* Do this!
*   **Zero-Prep Fridays:** If you're too tired to cook, just grab a monitored freezer meal. The system will subtract it from your inventory automatically when you log it.

## ⚡ Quick Tips

*   **Friday is "No Prep" day.** The plan ensures you never have to chop vegetables on a Friday night.
*   **Variety is guaranteed.** You won't see the same recipe twice in 3 weeks.
*   **Device-Free Evenings.** The plan is designed so usually all the hard work is done *before* 5 PM.
