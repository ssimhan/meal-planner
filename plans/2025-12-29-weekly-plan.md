## From Scratch Recipe This Week
**Chana Masala (IP)** - This classic Indian chickpea curry is the perfect "from scratch" recipe for this week. It uses fresh tomatoes, cilantro, garlic, and ginger from the farmers market, creating a deeply flavorful, aromatic curry using the Instant Pot. The layered spices (cumin, coriander, garam masala) and slow-building flavors make this an authentic, interesting recipe that goes beyond simple weeknight cooking. Making a double batch lets us freeze half for future backup meals, and the active cooking time is still manageable for a Monday when we have more energy. This introduces complex Indian spice combinations while using fresh market vegetables.

**Adult Lunch Defaults:**
