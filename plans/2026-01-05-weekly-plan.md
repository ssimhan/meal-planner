Making the potato-corn tikkis (patties) from scratch involves hands-on cooking with aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala, creating crispy golden fritters that get wrapped in flatbread with cilantro chutney and fresh vegetables. It's a fun, interactive cooking experience that transforms simple potatoes and corn into an exciting handheld meal the whole family will enjoy.
