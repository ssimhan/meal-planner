# 3-Ingredient Cereal Bars

### Ingredients
- US Customary Metric
- ½cup smooth natural peanut butter (like Smucker's Natural)
- ½cup honey (or brown rice syrup)
- 3½cups O cereal (like Cheerios)
- ½teaspoon vanilla extract, optional

### Instructions
1. Here’s a look at how to make this recipe so you know what to expect. Scroll down to the end of the post for the full recipe.
2. Line an 8×8-inch baking sheet with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides (which will make it easy to lift the bars out when it's time to slice them).
3. Add the peanut butter and honey to a large heat-safe bowl. Warm in the microwave for 15-30 seconds, or until easy to stir. (This may not be necessary if you keep your peanut butter and honey at room temperature.) Stir together to combine.
4. Add the cereal and vanilla, if using, to the bowl. Stir gently, but thoroughly, using a wooden spoon or spatula. It may take a minute or two to get the mixture evenly coated.
5. Press mixture into the prepared baking pan, gently pressing evenly and into the corners.
6. Chill for at least 20 minutes. Remove from the fridge, lift out using the parchment paper, and slice on a cutting board.
7. Wrap each bar in plastic wrap (optional) and store in an airtight container in the fridge. Serve cold.
