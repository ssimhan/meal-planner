8. Add the milk, cheese, and butter to the blender with the squash and puree until completely smooth.
9. Meanwhile, bring the water back to a boil and cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain and return to the pot.
10. Stir in the cheese sauce, season to taste with salt, and serve warm.
