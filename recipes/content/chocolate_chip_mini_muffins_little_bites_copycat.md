# Chocolate Chip Mini Muffins (Little Bites Copycat)

### Prep Steps

<!-- List prep tasks here -->

### Ingredients
- AD
- 1cupall-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½teaspoon baking soda
- ¼teaspoon salt
- 1cupwhole milk plain Greek yogurt
- ⅓cup maple syrup (or sugar)
- ¼cup unsalted butter (melted and slightly cooled)
- 2 eggs (lightly beaten)
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- ¾cup mini chocolate chips

### Instructions
1. AD
2. Stir together the wet ingredients.
3. Stir together the dry ingredients, then mix in the wet. Add the chocolate chips.
4. Divide among a greased mini muffin pan.
5. Bake! These muffins bake quickly, so set that timer and avoid over baking for the best results.
6. Use a small knife to help transfer the cooked muffins to a wire rack to cool fully. (Note that I do not recommend using paper cupcake liners with these as they will likely stick. Nonstick spray is a better option.)
7. AD
8. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 24-cup mini muffin pan with nonstick spray.
9. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
10. In another bowl, stir together the yogurt, maple syrup, eggs, butter, and vanilla.
11. Gently stir the yogurt mixture into the flour mixture.
12. Stir in the chocolate chips.
13. Divide batter among the prepared muffin tin, filling about to the edge. (You'll use about 1 ½ tablespoon in each mini muffin cup.)
14. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out cleanly. Do not over bake.
15. Remove from oven, and let cool in the pan for 2 minutes. Run a paring knife around the edges to loosen, if needed, then carefully transfer muffins to a wire rack to cool fully.
