# Cucumber Sandwiches

### Ingredients
- 16 slices bread
- 1 English cucumber
- 8 ounces cream cheese
- Dill
- Chives
- lemon juice
- garlic
- Salt and black pepper

## Prep Steps
- Slice cucumber
- Wash and chop herbs
- Mince garlic

### Instructions
1. Peel the cucumber in stripes and cut into 1/8-inch thin slices using a mandolin or sharp knife. Place the slices on paper towels and sprinkle with coarse salt. Let rest for 15-30 minutes to extract moisture. Pat dry with clean paper towels.
2. In the meantime, make the spread. In a medium bowl, using a handheld mixer, blend together the softened cream cheese, mayo, dill, chives, lemon juice, garlic powder, and salt.
3. Spread one side of each slice of bread with the herbed cream cheese.
4. Layer cucumber slices over half of the bread slices. Season with fresh cracked black pepper, to taste. Top with remaining bread slices, cream cheese mixture down. (At this point, you'll have 8 full sandwiches.)
5. Using a sharp Chef's knife, cut each sandwich into quarters, pushing through the bread down to the bottom. So you have 32 tea sandwiches.
6. Serve right away and enjoy!
7. To Make Ahead“One day before, the sandwiches were made and cut and layered with damp doubled paper towels in a fish bin (or on a sheet pan, and then saran wrapped) and refrigerated.”
