- 1cupdiced green bell pepper (cut into large squares)
- 12ozpaneer cubed
- 1/2cupwater

### Instructions
1. In a large pot over medium high heat add the oil. Once the oil is hot add the cumin seeds and let them splutter for a few seconds.
2. Add the diced onions and cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes until the onions are golden. I like to add a pinch of salt to the onions to help them cook faster.
3. Now add the garlic, ginger, and all the spices except for Kasuri methi, red bell peppers, green bell peppers and mix well. Stir this for about 2 minutes so everything has a chance to mix well and then add 1/2 cup of water , mix well and place a lid on the pot. Reduce heat to low and let this cook covered for about 10 minutes.
4. Remove the lid and give everything a good mix and now add the cubed paneer, corn, cilantro, kasuri methi and salt. Stir and taste for salt- adjust as needed. Place a lid on the pot and let it cook for an additional 5 minutes!
5. Serve hot with paratha and or rice!
