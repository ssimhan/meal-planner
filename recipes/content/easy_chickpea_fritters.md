# Easy Chickpea Fritters

### Ingredients
- US Customary Metric
- 14.5- ounce can chickpeas (rinsed and drained; sometimes called garbanzo beans)
- ¼cup all-purpose flour
- ¼cup grated Parmesan cheese (or nutritional yeast to make dairy-free)
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- ½teaspoon garlic powder
- ½teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

### Instructions
1. Below is a preview of how to make this recipe so you know what to expect from the process. Scroll down to the end of the post for the full recipe, including the amounts and the timing.
2. Drain the chickpeas (I save the liquid for an egg replacer to use in baking). Rinse with cold water (this removes some of the sodium).
3. Add to a shallow dish or bowl with the rest of the ingredients except the olive oil.
4. Mash with a potato masher or fork until very smooth.
5. Form into round, flat patties using 1 tablespoon batter in each. Add olive oil to a pan or skillet over medium heat and cook the fritters until golden brown.
