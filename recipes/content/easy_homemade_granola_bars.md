- ½cup shredded unsweetened coconut (or use ½ cup additional oats)

### Instructions
1. Here’s a look at the easy process involved in making this granola bar recipe. Scroll down to the bottom of this post for the full recipe.
2. Add ingredients to a food processor, choosing your flavor. Grind until the mixture starts to hold together.
3. Pour the batter onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and press flat.
4. Score the batter with a knife, which makes them easy to break into pieces once they’re baked.
5. Bake, let cool, and enjoy.
6. CAN I MAKE THESE WITHOUT CHIA SEEDS?
7. Sure! See the variation at the bottom that calls for omitting them and slightly increasing the nut butter. This keeps a good amount of healthy fats to ensure that the bars hold together and that the kids get a nicely balanced snack.
8. CAN I MAKE THESE GLUTEN-FREE GRANOLA BARS?
9. These bars are naturally egg-free and dairy-free. They’re also easy to make gluten-free by choosing gluten-free oats and a gluten-free flour blend.
10. HOW LONG DO THESE HEALTHY GRANOLA BARS LAST?
11. I store our homemade granola bars in the fridge (because I like them cold) in an airtight container and serve them up until we run out.
12. In the fridge in an airtight container, they’ll stay fresh for about two weeks.
13. At room temperature in an airtight container, they’ll last about 1 week.
14. In the freezer, you can place cooled bars in a sealed zip top freezer bag for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before serving.
15. CAN I FREEZE GRANOLA BARS?
16. Yes, this granola bar recipe freezes really well. Simply let them cool and place into a zip top freezer bag. Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge or at room temperature, or directly in a lunchbox.
17. Flavor Variations
18. I’m so happy that a reader suggested this because it works so well to use a fruit or veggie puree instead of water in the original recipe! I’ve tried making Applesauce Granola Bars, Banana Granola Bars, Butternut Squash, Sweet Potato, and Pumpkin Granola Bars.
19. Look in the Notes at the bottom of the recipe for the info.
20. Best Tips for Success
21. For kids under one, you can substitute brown rice syrup for the honey. You can also try using applesauce.
22. You can make them in the basic flavor, or banana, apple, sweet potato, butternut squash, or pumpkin.
23. To make these without coconut, omit and use additional oats.
24. To make these without chia seeds, omit and increase the nut butter to ¼ cup.
25. To make this without a food processor, use quick or instant oats and stir everything together. (Or grind the oats and coconut in a blender, then stir the ingredients together in a bowl)
26. Add chocolate chips to this recipe by pressing a few into the top of the rolled out batter just before baking.
27. Use room temperature honey and nut or seed butter to make the batter come together easily, or warm them briefly.
28. Wet your fingers or use a piece of parchment to press the batter down if it’s sticking to your hands.

30. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat. Warm the honey and peanut butter for about 15 seconds if not stored at room temperature.
31. Place the oats and coconut into the bowl of a food processor and blitz to grind into a coarse texture (similar to quick oats).
32. Add the remaining ingredients, including the peanut butter and honey, and blend well.
33. (You can also grind the oats or use instant oats, then mix everything together in a bowl.)
34. Add ¼ cup water and blend until batter comes together like thick cookie dough. You should be able to press the batter together between your fingers and have it stick together. If it doesn't, add a bit more water.
35. Place batter onto the center of the prepared baking sheet and use your hands to press thin, about ¼-½-inch thick and about 8x8-inches big. I measure roughly using an 8x8-inch baking pan. (You can also roll out the dough—just cover it with a piece of parchment paper first to make sure it's easy to do.) Use a knife to lightly score lines for squares in whatever size you like.
36. Bake for 18-20 minutes, remove from oven, and let cool completely on the pan.
37. Break into squares and serve.
38. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks in the fridge or a week at room temperature. To freeze, place cooled bars in a sealed zip top freezer bag for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before serving.
