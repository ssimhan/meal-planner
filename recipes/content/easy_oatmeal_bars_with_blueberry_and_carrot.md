# Easy Oatmeal Bars (with Blueberry and Carrot)

### Ingredients
- 1 Oatmeal Bars
- SNACKS
- 3-Ingredient Cereal Bars
- AD
- ¾cup quick or instant oats (or rolled oats ground up in the food processor or blender)
- ½cup whole wheat flour
- ½teaspoon baking powder
- ½teaspoon cinnamon
- ¼teaspoon salt
- ¼cup melted coconut oil (or butter)
- ¼cup creamy unsweetened almond butter
- ¼cup maple syrup
- 1 egg (optional)
- ½cup grated carrot
- ½cup blueberries (cut in half if very large)

### Instructions
1. AD
2. Preheat the oven and line a pan with parchment paper. Add the ingredients to a bowl.
3. Stir together gently, trying not to smash the berries.
4. Press into the prepared pan, pressing evenly to the edges.
5. Bake and remove from the oven. Let cool completely before slicing.
6. AD
7. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line an 8×8-inch pan with parchment paper so it overhangs on two sides so the bars are easy to lift out once baked and cooled.
8. Mix together all of the ingredients in a medium bowl except the blueberries. (Add the egg if using.) Stir in the blueberries gently.
9. Press into the prepared pan so the batter is even and pressed to the edges.
10. Bake for 24-26 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden brown and set.
11. Cool fully. (Really, please let it sit until it's cool to the touch! You can pop it into the fridge to speed this up if you'd like. It may crumble a bit if you slice when still warm.)
12. Slice into bars and serve or store. I typically cut into 16 small squares, but you can cut them larger if desired.
13. You can use honey instead of maple syrup.
14. I prefer the texture of carrots that are grated at home on a box grater as they are finer than those you can buy at the store.
15. Fresh blueberries work best in this recipe (frozen ones can cause the batter to seize up and be hard to press into the pan).
16. Cool fully before slicing to prevent the bars from crumbling when slicing.
