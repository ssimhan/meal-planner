# Easy Zucchini Pasta Sauce

### Ingredients
- Parmesan cheese, lemon zest, and/or fresh black pepper (optional but recommended)
- AD
- 2smallzucchini (about 2 cups sliced)
- 2 garlic cloves (peeled and minced)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½cup white beans (such as cannellini beans)
- 2 tablespoons basil leaves (or parsley or spinach, optional)
- 1 pound pasta
- Parmesan cheese, lemon zest, and/or fresh black pepper (optional but recommended)

### Instructions
1. Below is an overview of the method for the recipe. Scroll down to the end of the post for the specifics. The main thing to know ahead of time is that you’ll want to reserve a little of the pasta cooking water before you drain the pasta. You’ll use that to help thin the zucchini sauce.
2. AD
3. Cook the pasta, reserving a little of the pasta cooking water. Meanwhile, Slice your zucchini and mince the garlic.
4. Sautee until cooked through and lightly golden brown.
5. Add to a blender with the remaining sauce ingredients, including a little bit of reserved cooking water.
6. Blend smooth.
7. How to Store
8. Store any remaining sauce in airtight containers in the fridge for up to 5 days. Or freeze in an ice cube tray overnight, transfer to a freezer bag, remove as much air as you can and freeze for up to 6 months.
9. Thaw 1-2 cubes overnight in the fridge in a container or at room temperature for about an hour and add to servings of pasta for easy meals.
10. Best Tips for Success
11. Trade in shallot or onion for the garlic if you like.
12. Use yellow summer squash if desired.
13. Add a few basil, spinach, or parsley leaves to enhance the green color.
14. Use any type of pasta you like, including regular, whole-wheat, or a bean-based pasta (which would be an easy way to add more iron to this meal).
15. If the kids don’t love sauce on their pasta, you can offer a small amount of the sauce with buttered pasta as shown above.
16. Reserve a little of the pasta cooking water to help thin the sauce as you blend it up.
17. Top with extra Parmesan, lemon, and black pepper as you like.
18. AD
19. Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Before draining, remove and reserve one cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain and set aside.
20. Meanwhile, cut the ends off of the zucchini and discard. Slice the zucchini about ¼-inch thick.
21. Add the olive oil to a medium skillet over medium heat. When warm, add the garlic. Toss to coat with the oil. Cook for 2 minutes, or until fragrant.
22. Add the zucchini and stir to coat with the oil. Cover and cook for 10-12 minutes, turning once or twice, or until the zucchini is very soft when poked with a fork. Remove from heat and let cool slightly for a few minutes.
23. Transfer the zucchini to a blender, adding the beans and optional herb or spinach. (That additional makes this a brighter green color.) Blend, starting slowly and working up to high. Add the pasta cooking water, ¼-cup at a time, to make a smooth sauce.
24. Add ½ of the sauce to the pasta and stir to combine. Add as much additional sauce as you like or store the remaining sauce for future use. Serve with Parmesan, lemon zest, and/or pepper as desired.
