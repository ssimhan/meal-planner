# Esquites (Mexican Street Corn Salad)

### Prep Steps

<!-- List prep tasks here -->

### Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter or extra-virgin olive oil
- 3½cups corn kernels (16 ounces frozen)
- ½teaspoon fine salt
- 2mediumcloves garlic, minced
- ¼cup mayonnaise*
- 1mediumfinely chopped jalapeño, optional
- 1 tablespoon lime juice, plus extra lime wedges for garnish
- 1 teaspoon chili powder, plus more for sprinkling
- Pinch of cayenne pepper (optional, for extra heat)
- ¼cup finely grated Cotija cheese**, plus more for sprinkling
- ¼cup finely chopped cilantro

### Instructions
1. Melt the butter in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium heat.
2. Once melted, add the corn and the salt (if using frozen corn, no need to defrost first). Cook, stirring just every minute or so, until the corn is warmed through and turning golden on the edges, about 5 to 8 minutes (turn the heat down to low if the corn starts jumping out of the pan).
3. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds, then remove the skillet from the heat.
4. Let the corn cool for a few minutes, then transfer it to a medium mixing bowl.
5. Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl (the mayonnaise, optional jalapeño, lime juice, chili powder, optional cayenne, cheese and cilantro). Stir to combine.
6. Season to taste with additional salt, if needed.
7. To serve, divide the mixture between small cups and garnish individual servings with a wedge of lime, perhaps a sprinkle of additional cheese and chili powder. Leftovers keep well, refrigerated, for about 4 days.
