# Favorite Pizza Rolls (with Spinach and Cheese)

### Ingredients
- 1cupbaby spinach
- 13-16 ounces pizza dough (at room temperature)
- 3/4cuppizza sauce
- 2cupsshredded mozzarella
- 1/4cupgrated Parmesan cheese

## Prep Steps
- Wash and chop greens

### Instructions
1. Prep:Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. Grease a muffin tin, making sure to coat the top edges of each cup (cheese may spill over).
3. Stretch the pizza dough into an 11x16-inch rectangle on a piece of parchment paper (this will prevent sticking). If the dough is too tough to stretch, let it rest for 5 minutes and try again.
4. Chop the spinach if it's not pre-chopped.
5. Cook:Spread the Toppings: Spread pizza sauce over the dough. Sprinkle on the spinach, mozzarella, and Parmesan evenly.
6. Roll the Dough: Starting on one long side, roll the dough up into a log, using the parchment paper to help you roll.
7. Slice: Cut the rolled dough into 12 even slices using a serrated knife. To make it easier, start cutting in the center, then work on cutting each half evenly.
8. Bake: Place each slice into the greased muffin tin. Bake for 22-26 minutes, or until the dough is baked through, the cheese is melted, and the tops are golden brown.
9. Cool: Let the rolls cool in the muffin tin for 3-5 minutes to let the cheese firm up. Use a knife to loosen any stuck cheese before transferring them to a wire rack or serving plate.
10. Storage:Fridge: Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.Freezer: Freeze in a zip-lock bag for up to 3 months. To reheat, microwave frozen rolls for 30-60 seconds or until warm.
