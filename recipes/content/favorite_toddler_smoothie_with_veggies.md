# Favorite Toddler Smoothie (with Veggies!)

## Prep Steps
- Chop zucchini
- Peel/chop squash
- Cut florets
- Wash and chop greens

### Instructions
1. Add the milk to the blender. (We prefer nondairy milks since they seem to have a slightly better consistency and less of a tendency to separate after blending.)
2. Add the fruit and veggie.
3. Add any optional ingredients.
4. Blend the smoothie really well to ensure that it has a very creamy texture.
5. Serve it in a reusable pouch, a small open cup, or in a sippy cup depending on what your kid likes best.
6. AD
7. Add chosen ingredients to a blender.
8. Blend until very smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl and adding more liquid if needed.
9. Serve immediately.
