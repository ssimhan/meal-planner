### Instructions
1. Choose your yogurt.
2. Add to a plastic bag and pipe out.
3. Freeze.
4. Serve or transfer to a storage bag.
5. AD
6. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
7. Add the yogurt to a zip top bag and seal. Cut off one bottom corner and gently squeeze out little dots of yogurt in rows on the prepared tray. (I make them about the size of a dime, though you can go smaller to the size of a pencil eraser.)
8. Place tray into the freezer and freeze for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.
9. To serve, remove from the freezer and let sit at room temperature for 3-5 minutes before serving to ensure they aren’t frozen solid. (You can try one to make sure it melts easily on your tongue!) Babies and toddlers should be able to pick them up with their hands.
