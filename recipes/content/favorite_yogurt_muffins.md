## Prep Steps
- Chop carrots

### Instructions
1. With a base recipe that bakes up perfectly fluffy and just-sweet-enough muffins, and 6 options to add flavors from fruit, veggies, spices, and chocolate chips, this Yogurt Muffin recipe is as versatile as it is delicious!
2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 12-cup standard muffin pan with nonstick spray.
3. In a medium bowl, stir together the flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
4. In another bowl, stir together the yogurt, maple syrup, butter, eggs, and vanilla.
5. Gently stir the yogurt mixture into the flour mixture. (Expect the batter to be thick.)
6. Add your desired add-in. (You can also add 1 tablespoon of any add-in to each muffin cup, using ¼ cup batter, to make a batch with a few different flavors. Or you can bake them plain.) Stir gently to combine.
7. Divide batter among the prepared muffin tin, using about ¼ cup batter in each cup.
8. Bake for 16-18 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from oven, then transfer muffins to a wire rack to cool fully.
9. Top with butter, nut butter, or jam as desired.
