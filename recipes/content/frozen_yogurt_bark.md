### Prep Steps

<!-- List prep tasks here -->

### Ingredients
- US Customary Metric
- 1cupfrozen wild blueberries (or other desired fruit)
- 1cupregular or Greek-style plain yogurt (whole-milk yogurt preferred)
- ½cup full-fat coconut milk (the solids from one 14.5-ounce can)
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup (or honey, optional to taste)
- cereal, sprinkles, additional fruit (for topping, optional)

### Instructions
1. To make the blended option, add the berries, yogurt, maple syrup and coconut milk to a blender.
2. Blend until smooth.
3. Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper. (This makes the bark easier to break once it’s frozen since it won’t freeze to the pan.) Pour the blended yogurt mixture overtop. Smooth to about ¼-½ inch thick. Add optional toppings if using.
4. Freeze for at least 4 hours. To serve, break into pieces and eat immediately.
5. (To make without a blender, stir together the yogurt and coconut milk, spread on the prepared pan, then top with optional toppings and freeze.)

7. Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper. Pour the blended yogurt mixture overtop. Smooth to about ¼-½ inch thick. Add optional toppings if using.
