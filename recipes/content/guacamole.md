# Guacamole

### Ingredients
- 2 ripe avocados
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2to 4 tablespoons minced red onion
- 2 tablespoons cilantro, finely chopped
- Pinch freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 ripe tomato, chopped

## Prep Steps
- Chop onions/shallots
- Wash and chop herbs

### Instructions
1. Cut the avocados, score and mash in the bowl.
2. Sprinkle with salt and lime (or lemon) juice.
3. Add the chopped onion, cilantro, black pepper.
4. If making a few hours ahead, place plastic wrap on the surface of the guacamole and press down to cover it to prevent air reaching it. (The oxygen in the air causes oxidation which will turn the guacamole brown.)
5. Refrigerate leftover guacamole up to 3 days.
