# Healthy Breakfast Bars with Jam

### Prep Steps

<!-- List prep tasks here -->

### Ingredients
- 2cupsrolled oats
- 1/4cuphoney
- 1/4cuppeanut butter
- 1/4cupwhole wheat flour
- 1/4cupmilk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 2/3cupall-fruit jam

### Instructions
1. Line the pan with parchment paper.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line an 8×8-inch baking sheet. Leave a few inches overhang on two sides so you can easily lift the bars out when they’re cooled.
3. Place the oats into the bowl of a food processor or blender and blitz to grind into a coarse flour.
4. Place the honey and peanut butter into a medium bowl and warm in the microwave for about 15 seconds.
5. Add the oats and the remaining ingredients except the jam to the bowl with the peanut butter and honey and stir together.
6. Use clean hands to bring the dough together as needed to form a thick, cookie dough-like texture. It will hold together when pressed between your fingers.
7. Set aside ¾ cup of the batter.
8. Place the remaining batter into the bottom of the prepared baking pan and press down evenly to cover.
9. Spread the jam on top.
10. Crumble the remaining dough over the jam and press down slightly.
11. Bake for 22-24 minutes, remove from oven, and let cool completely in the pan. (You can speed this up by sticking the pan into the fridge.
12. Lift the bars out using the parchment paper and slice into bars.
