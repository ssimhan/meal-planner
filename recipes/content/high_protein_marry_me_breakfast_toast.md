1. Heat a skillet over medium heat and add olive oil, asafoetida, Italian seasoning, chilli flakes and paprika. Sauté for 1 minute. Then add sun-dried tomatoes, oregano and olives. Sauté for 2 minutes. Add balsamic vinegar and tomato paste and cook for additional 2 minutes.
2. Add coconut milk and nutritional yeast and mix until well combined. Pour in butter beans and sauté for another 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust the salt as desired.
3. In a food processor combine cottage cheese and feta until completely smooth. If desired without feta, simply whip the cottage cheese until a smooth consistency.
4. To assemble: On a slice of toast, spread desired amount of whipped cottage cheese, layer butter beans on top, sprinkle with parsley and optional chilli crisp. Enjoy!
