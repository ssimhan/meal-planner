# Homemade Frozen Yogurt

### Ingredients
- 1cupfrozen berries (such as raspberries, strawberries, cherries, or blueberries, mango, pineapple, or banana slices)
- 1/2cupvanilla Greek yogurt

### Instructions
1. Add frozen fruit and yogurt to the blender.
2. Blend, starting slowly, then gradually increasing. (I have a Vitamix blender) and use the stick that came with it to help things keep moving since the mixture is thick.)
3. Keep blending until smooth and uniform in texture. (If your blender doesn’t have a stick to help move ingredients and the mixture is getting stuck, you can add a tablespoon or two of milk or orange juice to help things move.)
4. You can also use a food processor if that’s what you have.
5. Combine the ingredients in a high-powered blender.
6. Blend until very smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed (and using the stick attachment if one came with your blender).
7. Serve immediately.
8. You can use plain yogurt, too. If using plain, sweeten to taste with maple syrup or honey as needed. (It will depend on which fruit you use and how sweet it is.)
9. To store leftovers, place into a freezer-safe container and freeze for up to a month. Let sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes to soften before serving. You can also freeze into popsicle molds.
