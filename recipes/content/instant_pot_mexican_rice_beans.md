# Instant Pot Mexican Rice & Beans

### Prep Steps

<!-- List prep tasks here -->

### Ingredients
- 1cupBasmati Rice, uncooked, rinsed and drained
- 115oz. can of pinto beans
- 1/2cupcorn
- 1 medium onion
- 1.25 cups vegetable broth (or water)
- 1cupjarred salsa
- 1.5 tbsp taco seasoning
- 1tspchili powder
- 1tspcumin powder
- 1tspsalt
- 2 medium serrano chilis, finely diced
- 6clovesgarlic
- 2 scallions, finely chopped with whites and green parts separated
- 2tbspoil
- shredded cheese (optional topping)
- lettuce (optional topping)
- pico de gallo (optional topping)
- sour cream (optional topping)

### Instructions
1. Turn the Instant Pot on saute mode and add 2 tbsp of oil. Once the oil is hot, add the green chilis and white parts of the scallions. Let them splutter for about 30 seconds or so and then add the diced onions.
2. Saute the onions for about 2-3 minutes until they are slightly soft. Hit cancel to turn the IP off and then immediately add the rinsed rice, salt, garlic, taco seasoning, chili powder, and cumin powder. Stir for about 2 minutes until garlic is fragrant but not browned.
3. Add the broth, and use a spatula to scrape up and browned bits of spices stuck to the pot (be sure to do this well so you don't get a BURN notice on your IP. Once you've added the broth, stir well.
4. Next, add the salsa into the IP but do not mix it it in, just place it in the center right over the rice and do not touch it.
5. Place your lid on the IP and set the IP to High Pressure Cook Mode and set the timer for 4 minutes. Once the IP beeps (and the pressure cooking phase is complete) quick release after 10 minutes.
6. Open the IP and use a fork to fluff and mix the rice very gently. Mixing the rice too vigourously at this stage will break the rice up and make it mushy. Let the rice sit for about 5 minutes. Next add in the pinto beans, corn and remaining green parts of the scallions. Taste for salt and adjust as needed.
7. Serve as a side, topped with shredded lettuce, pico de gallo and a dollop of sour cream.
