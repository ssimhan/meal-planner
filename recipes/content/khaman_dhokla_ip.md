# Khaman Dhokla IP

### Ingredients
- 1¼cup besan chickpea flour
- 2 tablespoon Semolina (Sooji/Rava) fine
- 1 teaspoon Sugar
- ½teaspoon Salt
- ¼teaspoon Ground Turmeric (Haldi powder)
- 1 green chili, minced
- 2 teaspoon Lime juice
- 1 tablespoon Oil
- 1 teaspoon Ginger grated
- 1cupWater
- 1 teaspoon Eno fruit salt
- 2cupsWater for steaming
- For tempering (tadka)
- 2 tablespoon Oil
- 1 teaspoon Mustard Seeds
- 5 Curry Leaves
- 1 teaspoon Sesame seeds
- ¼cup Water
- 1 teaspoon Sugar
- ¼teaspoon Salt

### Instructions
1. Prepare Khaman Batter:
2. Mix in all of the ingredients, except the Eno fruit salt – gram flour, semolina, turmeric, salt, sugar, green chili, ginger, lime juice, oil and water. Stir to combine well and let the batter sit for 15 minutes.
3. While the batter is resting, boil 2 cups water in the pressure cooker on sauté mode. Also, grease the steel pan in which you will make the khaman with oil. I used one container from the stackable steel containers for the instant pot.
4. After 15 minutes, add Eno to the batter and stir it gently in one direction. The batter will become frothy and increase in volume. Do not over stir.
5. Quickly transfer the batter to the greased steel container and place the container on a trivet. It is important to start cooking quickly after adding Eno to get soft and fluffy Khaman.
6. Steaming in Instant Pot
7. Then place the trivet along with the pan in the instant pot. Set to Steam mode for 15 mins in venting mode. The instant pot timer does not work in venting mode, hence you will need to set an external timer.
8. After the cooking time is done, let the khaman sit for 5 minutes. Then open the lid of the instant pot and take out the khaman using tongs.
9. Let it cool for 5 more minutes, so it is easy to remove. Insert a knife or toothpick to check it is cooked. The knife should come out almost clean. If not, you will need to steam for 2-3 more minutes.
10. Run a knife around the edges of the khaman. Place a plate on top of the container and turn it upside down. This will help to get the khaman out of the container easily.
11. Prepare Tempering
12. While the khaman is steaming in the instant pot, heart oil in a pan on stovetop on high heat.
13. Then add the mustard seeds and let them sizzle. Now add the curry leaves. Let them sauté for about 30 seconds. Add the sesame seeds and turn off heat.
14. Now add water, sugar, salt and stir well.
15. Cut the khaman into small pieces. Spread the tempering over it.
16. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with green mint chutney.
