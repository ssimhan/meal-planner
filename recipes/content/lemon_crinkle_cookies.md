# Lemon Crinkle Cookies

### Ingredients
- 2cupsall-purpose flour
- 1tspcorn starch
- 1tspbaking powder
- ½tsp salt
- ¾cup room temperature unsalted butter (or vegan butter)
- 1cupgranulated sugar
- 2 vegan egg (I used Bob's Red Mill egg replacer)
- 2tbspfresh lemon juice
- 1largelemon zested
- 1tspvanilla extract
- ½cup mini vegan white chocolate chips
- Optional yellow food dye (I used 3 drops of organic yellow dye)
- ROLLING INGREDIENTS
- 4tbspgranulated sugar
- 1cupconfectioners’ sugar

### Instructions
1. In a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, cornstarch, and salt. Set aside.
2. Zest the lemon into a small bowl. And press the lemon juice into a separate bowl.
3. Using a mixer, beat the butter and sugar on high speed for 3-4 minutes. It should be soft and pale. Scrape the bowl using a rubber spatula.
4. Add in the lemon zest, lemon juice, vanilla and egg replacer. Mix on medium until combined. Add in the yellow gel food dye if desired. I added 3 drops.
5. Add in the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until just combined. Add in the white chocolate chips and mix on low.
6. Cover dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. Chilling is required for this sticky cookie dough.
7. Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator.
8. Preheat the oven to 350℉. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Let the cookie dough rest for 10 minutes. This helps to prevent too much spread.
9. Place the sugar in one bowl and the powdered sugar in another bowl. Use a small cookie scoop (1 oz or 1 Tablespoon) and scoop the dough. Place 12 cookie dough balls per cookie sheet.
10. Roll the cookie dough ball in the sugar first. Then, roll in the powdered sugar. Make sure it has a thick coat of powdered sugar.
11. Once all rolled, bake for 11-13 minutes. Bake until the edges are set. Make sure to not over bake these, otherwise they will be dry and the powdered sugar will melt.
12. Cool the cookies on the hot pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.
