### Instructions
1. Add masoor dal & moong dal to a pot or pressure cooker. Wash it a few times until the water runs clear.
2. Next add chopped tomatoes, water and green chili.
3. Pressure cook for 1 to 2 whistles on a medium heat. If cooking in a pot, bring the water to a rolling boil, reduce the heat and cook until soft, adding more hot water if needed. Skim off any froth that rises to the top.
4. Once the pressure drops, open the cooker.
5. Mash the dal to suit your liking. You can make it smooth or keep it coarse for a texture. If needed you can pour 2 to 3 tbsp hot water to bring it to a consistency.
6. **Temper/ Tadka**Heat ghee (or oil or butter) in a small pan, on a medium heat.
7. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, dried red chilies and chopped garlic.
8. Saute until the garlic turns slightly golden. Turn off the heat and add hing, chili powder, turmeric & garam masala.
9. Quickly pour this off to the dal. (If you want you may set aside half of the tempering along with red chili to garnish later.)
10. Time to add salt and crushed kasuri methi if using. Mix and simmer for 2 mins. Taste test and add more salt if required.
11. Squeeze in some lemon & garnish with chopped coriander leaves before serving. Masoor dal is ready to serve with roti or rice.
12. **Instant Pot Masoor Dal**Press saute button on the Instant pot and pour oil to the inner pot.
13. Add mustard, cumin, broken red chilies and garlic.
14. When they splutter add tomatoes along with salt, chilli powder, hing, garam masala (optional) and turmeric.
15. Saute for 1 min. Next add dal, green chilli and 2 cups water.
16. Stir well and deglaze to release any bits of food stuck. Secure the Instant pot with lid. Set the steam release handle to sealing.
17. Optional :You can cook basmati rice together by placing the rice bowl on a long legged trivet.
18. Press pressure cook button and set the timer for 7 mins.
19. Wait for the pressure to release naturally. When the pin drops, open the IP.
20. Add kasuri methi and stir well. Taste test and add more salt or garam masala if required. If the dal is runny, cook on saute mode for a few minutes. If it is too thick pour little hot water and saute for a minute.
21. Squeeze lemon juice and garnish with chopped coriander leaves. Serve masoor dal with rice.
