<!-- List prep tasks here -->

### Ingredients

- 1 red bell pepper
- 1 green bell pepper
- 1/2cupcorn
- 1 medium Jalapeno

- 1/2tspsalt
- 1/4tspred chili powder
- 1/4tspturmeric
- 2clovesgarlic
- 1/2cupshredded mexican cheese

### Instructions
1. Quick Soak Sabudana
2. Heat 2-3 cups of water until it is boiling hot. It’s convenient to do this in a hot water kettle or right on the stove.
3. Rinse the sabudana thoroughly (wash about 2-3 times until you get clear liquid). Drain the liquid and place in a deep bowl.
4. Pour 1.5 cups of the hot water on top of the sabudana and let it sit for 30 minutes.
5. After 30 minutes, press a few of the sabudana between your fingers- they should be soft.
6. Drain the sabudana , rinse with cold water and transfer the sabudana to a wide colander or spread out in a large pan until the sabudana is completely dry (about 15-20 minutes).
7. Directions
8. In a large pot, heat the oil over medium high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and scallion whites and stir.
9. Next add the bell peppers, turmeric, chili powder, taco seasoning and cook on low heat until the bell peppers are soft.
10. Once the peppers are soft, add the garlic and salt.
11. Add the sabudana, cilantro, lime juice, green scallions and mix until everything is well combined.I like my sabudana a little sticky and more soft so I cook it for an additional 5-6 minutes until I get that texture.
12. Remove from heat, top off cheese, a dollop of sour cream and enjoy!!
