- 1tspcumin powder
- 1 cup1 milk
- 1cupcheddar, shredded

## Prep Steps
- Chop onions/shallots

### Instructions
1. The quantities in this are for 4-5 adult servings. Plan for two dinners or cut in half.
2. Chop onion, carrots and broccoli before turning on IP.
3. Turn the Instant Pot onto saute mode and add oil and butter. Once the butter is melted, add the diced onions and carrots and stir until slightly softened (about 3-4 minutes).
4. Heat 1L+ water for broth.
5. Add the garlic, cumin powder, salt, and quinoa and stir for 2-3 minutes until everything is well combined.
6. Add the broth, mix again and then place the broccoli florets directly on top of the mixture (without mixing them in).
7. Switch the Instant Pot to High Pressure mode and set timer for 1 minute. Quick Release after 5 minutes. Total time should be roughly 10 minutes
8. Open the pot, switch the IP to saute mode and add in the milk. Stir and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes so the quinoa slightly thickens. Add cheese and stir until well combined. Taste for salt and add extra if needed. (The quinoa will thicken as it sits for a few minutes)
9. If you want to make this spicy, add a few dashes of crushed red chili flakes or sriracha.
10. Serve hot and enjoy! Store refrigerated for up to 3-4 days.
