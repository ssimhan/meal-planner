- 1 Tablespoon garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon cumin powder
- 2cupscilantro, washed and chopped
- 1/4cupqueso fresco, grated

## Prep Steps

### Instructions
1. Roasting the Poblano Peppers
2. Set your oven to a High Broil setting.
3. Brush the poblano peppers lightly with oil and broil on the top most rack, turning the peppers every 4-6 minutes or until all sides are charred and blackened.
4. Once the peppers are charred on each side remove them into a heat safe bowl or baking dish and cover tightly to sweat the peppers for about 5 minutes.
5. Uncover the peppers and peel off as much of the charred skin and the seeds as you can .
6. Discard the charred skin and seeds, roughly chop the peppers and set aside.
7. Make the Sauce
8. In a heavy bottom pot heat the butter and garlic over medium heat and add the flour.
9. Make a roux by constantly stirring the butter & flour mixture until it has a nutty fragrance and is golden in color, about 3 minutes.
10. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth in small amounts until the mixture is thick and bubbly.
11. Once you have added all of the broth, add the sour cream, poblano peppers, cilantro, cumin & salt. Stir until smooth and all ingredients are incorporated.
12. Take the pot off the stove and using an electric hand blender, blend the sauce until it is smooth and creamy. If you do not have an electric hand blender, work in batches and blend the cooled sauce in a regular blender carefully.
13. Add queso fresco to the sauce and set aside.
14. To assemble the enchiladas:
15. Heat a skillet on medium low, add 1 tsp of oil and add two or three flour tortillas to the pan depending on how big your pan is.
16. Working quickly, add about ¼ cup shredded chicken in the middle of the tortilla, top with a handful of the monterey jack cheese and seal the enchilada closed.
17. Lightly brown the wrapped enchiladas until they are golden brown on both sides. Remove from pan and place them in a an oven proof baking dish.
18. Continue to do this for the rest of the chicken & tortillas.
19. Place all of the enchiladas in an oven proof baking dish and poor the sauce generously over the top.
20. Bake for 15 minutes on 375 degrees or until hot and bubbly!
21. Garnish with sliced green onion, tomatoes, & queso fresco !
