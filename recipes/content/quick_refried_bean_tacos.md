# Quick Refried Bean Tacos

### Prep Steps

<!-- List prep tasks here -->

### Ingredients
- ½tablespoon olive oil
- 215-ounce cans refried beans
- ¼teaspoon garlic powder
- ½teaspoon cumin
- ½teaspoon salt
- 1 medium bell pepper, finely diced
- 1 red onion
- Taco seasoning
- Sriracha sauce
- Cilantro
- 8 tortillas
- Optional: Shredded cheese, feta or queso fresco, sour cream,

### Instructions
1. Make the filling: Mince the garlic. In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant but not yet browned (or skip this step and use garlic powder instead). Heat the refried beans, cumin and kosher salt until warmed, about 3 minutes. Taste and adjust flavors as desired.
2. Prep the veggies: Chop the lettuce. Dice the bell pepper. Prep the other toppings as desired. (If using pickled red onions, it’s easiest to make them in advance.)
3. Warm the tortillas: Warm and char the tortillas by placing them on an open gas flame on medium for a few seconds per side, flipping with tongs, until they are slightly blackened and warm. (See How to Warm Tortillas.)
4. Serve: Place the refried beans in the tortillas, then top with toppings and enjoy.
