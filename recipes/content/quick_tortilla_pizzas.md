### Instructions
1. Here’s a peek at how to make this recipe so you know what to expect from the process. Scroll down to the end of this post for the specific amounts and the timing.
2. Preheat the oven and line baking sheets with parchment paper for easy cleanup. Place the tortillas onto baking sheets. Top with pizza sauce, mozzarella, Parmesan, and any desired toppings.
3. Bake until warmed through and the cheese is just golden brown. Serve warm, slicing into wedges so it’s easy to eat.
4. How to Store
5. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat on a plate in the microwave for 30 seconds or heat through in a 375-degree-F oven.
6. Best Tips for Success
7. Use any type of tortilla you prefer. I usually use fajita-size whole wheat or regular flour ones, but the method is versatile.
8. Use dairy-free cheese as needed.
9. Serve with simple sides such as fruit, applesauce, salad, or roasted broccoli.
10. Fold the pizza in half to serve like a pizza quesadilla.
11. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
12. Place the tortillas onto 2 rimmed baking sheets. Top each with pizza sauce, spreading just to the edges, and the mozzarella, Parmesan, and any desired toppings.
13. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until warmed through and the cheese is just golden brown.
14. Serve warm, slicing up into wedges.
