# Rasam Rice with Broccoli Kai

### Ingredients
- 1 tsp tamarind concentrate
- 1 medium tomato, chopped
- 1 tsp black pepper (coarsely crushed)
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1/4 tsp turmeric powder
- 1/2 tsp rasam powder (or use more black pepper + cumin if unavailable)
- Salt to taste
- 3 cups water

## Prep Steps
- Mince garlic

### Instructions
1. Chop 1 medium tomato.
2. Crush 2 garlic cloves.
3. Cut 1/2 head of broccoli into small florets.
4. Cook 1 cup rice and keep it ready (preferably slightly mushy, like for rasam rice).
5. In a pot, mix 1 tsp tamarind concentrate with 3 cups water.
6. Add chopped tomato, crushed garlic, 1/4 tsp turmeric powder, 1 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp cumin seeds, 1/2 tsp rasam powder, and salt.
7. Let it simmer on medium heat for 10–12 minutes until tomatoes soften and flavors blend. Don't boil too hard—rasam should be light.
8. In a small pan, heat 1 tsp ghee or oil.
9. Add 1 tsp mustard seeds. When they splutter, add 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 1 red chilli, pinch of hing, and curry leaves.
10. Pour this tempering into the simmering rasam. Turn off heat.
11. Heat 1 tsp oil in a pan.
12. Add broccoli florets and sauté on medium heat for 4–5 minutes.
13. Sprinkle 1/4 tsp turmeric powder, 1/2 tsp red chilli powder, and salt.
14. Stir and cook until broccoli is tender but not mushy (about 3–4 more minutes).
15. In a bowl or plate, mix cooked rice with hot rasam.
16. Top or serve it with the sautéed broccoli kai on the side or mixed in.
