### Prep Steps

<!-- List prep tasks here -->

### Ingredients
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion
- 1/2 bell pepper, green
- 1cupcorn
- ½teaspoon chili powder
- ¼teaspoon ground cumin
- pinch salt
- Pepper
- 2clovesgarlic
- Tortillas
- ⅔cup refried beans, ⅓ cup or 5 tablespoons per burrito
- ½cup cooked brown rice, ¼ cup or 4 tablespoons per burrito
- ½avocado, halved, pitted, peeled, and sliced (about 3 to 4 slices per burrito)
- ¼cup crumbled queso cotija, 2 tablespoons per burrito
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, optional (if you want to pan fry the burritos)

### Instructions
1. Heat olive oil
2. Add shallot, bell pepper, corn, chili powder, cumin and a pinch each of salt and black pepper.
3. Cook, stirring every so often, for 3 to 5 minutes or until tender crisp. Stir in garlic.
4. To assemble each burrito, layer refried beans in the centre of the tortilla (about ⅓ cup per burrito), about ¼ cup of cooked rice on top, ½ of pepper mixture, a few slices of avocado and about 2 tablespoons of crumbled cheese per burrito.
5. To fold the burritos: For each one, bring one side of the tortilla up over the ingredients (covering them), fold in each side, then begin to tightly roll the burrito (keeping everything tucked in as you roll, so it's compact). Alternatively, you can fold the burrito your favourite way. Serve and enjoy! This burrito is delicious served with your favourite chips and salsa (or enjoy the burrito as is).
6. Optional (but delicious): Wipe out the frying pan and lightly grease with vegetable oil. Place over medium heat. Add burritos to the pan and warm for about 2 minutes per side.
