# Romesco Gnocchi

## Ingredients
- 1 cup almonds
- 2 garlic cloves
- 15-ounce can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 2largeroasted red peppers from a jar
- ½tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 pound packaged gnocchi
- 3cupsspinach
- 1cupromesco sauce
- ¼cup feta cheese crumbles, optional
- Kosher salt
- Pepper

## Prep Steps
- Mince garlic
- Chop peppers
- Roast almonds

## Instructions
1. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil, seasoned with about 1 tablespoon kosher salt.
2. Make the gnocchi sauce: Peel the garlic. In a blender or food processor, process all ingredients until smooth. Taste and add additional seasonings if desired.
3. Once the water is boiling, add the gnocchi and boil until they float, about 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, line a colander with spinach leaves. When the gnocchi are done, pour them into the colander with the spinach so that the boiling water wilts the spinach. Then pour the cooked gnocchi and spinach back into the pot and stir to a few times to evenly distribute the spinach.
5. Add 1 cup of the romesco sauce to the pot and stir. (Reserve and refrigerate the remaining 1 ½ cups for up to 1 week.)
6. For vegan, top with fresh ground black pepper. For vegetarian, top with black pepper and feta crumbles. If desired, add a drizzle of olive oil.
