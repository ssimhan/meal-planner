# Sambar Rice

## Ingredients
- ¾ cup toor dal (split pigeon peas)
- 1 cup rice
- 1–2 murungakkai (drumsticks)
- 1 medium onion
- 1 medium tomato
- 1 green chili (optional, for slight heat)
- 1½ tbsp sambar powder
- 1 tsp tamarind concentrate
- ¼ tsp turmeric powder
- Salt to taste
- 2 tsp oil or ghee
- ½ tsp mustard seeds
- A pinch of hing (asafoetida)
- Few curry leaves (optional)
- Water as needed (about 4–5 cups total)

## Prep Steps
- Chop onions/shallots

## Instructions
For the Sambar Rice:

Wash ¾ cup toor dal and pressure cook it with 2 cups water and ¼ tsp turmeric for 3–4 whistles until soft.

Wash 1 cup rice and cook it separately with 2–2½ cups water until soft (slightly mushy is okay for sambar rice).

Slice 1 medium onion and chop 1 medium tomato.

Cut 1–2 drumsticks (murungakkai) into 2-inch pieces.

Sambar Rice:

In a large pan, heat 2 tsp oil or ghee. Add ½ tsp mustard seeds. Once they splutter, add a pinch of hing and a few curry leaves.

Add the sliced onion and sauté for 2–3 minutes until slightly soft.

Add the chopped tomato and 1 chopped green chili (if using). Cook until the tomato turns soft.

Add the drumstick pieces and about 1 cup water. Let it cook for 7–10 minutes until drumsticks are soft.

Stir in 1½ tbsp sambar powder, 1 tsp tamarind concentrate, and salt. Cook for 2 more minutes.

Add the mashed toor dal and cooked rice. Mix well. Adjust water if needed to get a soft, semi-liquid consistency.

Let it simmer for 5 more minutes. Taste and adjust salt or tamarind.

Turn off heat and drizzle ghee on top if you like.
