8. Remove from heat.

10. In a medium size skillet melt over medium heat, add 1/2 tablespoon of butter until it is foamy and melted.
11. Lay two slices of bread down on the pan and spread one of the slices with roughly 1 tablespoon of cilantro chutney and the other slice with about 1 tablespoon of apple butter chutney.
12. Add a slice of cheese or handful of shredded cheese on top of the cilantro chutney, then top with about 1/3 cup of the potato mixture, using the back of a spoon to press it down, and then place the remaining slice of bread (apple butter chutney side down) on top.

Repeat with remaining ingredients and add butter as needed to the pan.
