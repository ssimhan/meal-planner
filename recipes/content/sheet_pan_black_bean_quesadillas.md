# Sheet Pan Black Bean Quesadillas

### Ingredients
- Flour tortillas
- 2cansblack beans
- Shredded cheese, cheddar
- Sweet potato puree
- Cumin powder
- Salsa, cilantro, sour cream, guacamole, optional

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Place the tortillas on a baking sheet. They can overlap a little. Spread 1 tablespoon of pumpkin puree on half of each tortilla. (You'll leave one half empty so you can fold it over to make a half-moon shape.)
3. Top puree with ¼ cup beans, ¼ cheese, and a sprinkle of cumin.
4. Bake for 5- 7 minutes or until heated through and melty. Fold the empty side of the tortilla over and press down. Flip over and bake for an additional 2-3 minutes and remove from the oven.
5. Cut with kitchen shears and serve with desired dippings.
