5. While in the oven, take the coleslaw mix, rinse with water and drain well.
6. Add some mayo, lime juice, salt, red chili powder and garlic powder.
7. Serve quesadillas with side of coleslaw.
8. Alternative to coleslaw:Cucumber, tomatoes, oil, vinegar or lime juice, salt and pepper to taste with some cilantro
