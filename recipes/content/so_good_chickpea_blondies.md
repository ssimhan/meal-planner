# So Good Chickpea Blondies

### Ingredients
- US Customary Metric
- 14.5- ounce can chickpeas (also called "garbanzo" beans)
- ½cup sliced very ripe banana
- ¼cup unsweetened creamy peanut butter
- ¼cup maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½teaspoon salt
- ½teaspoon baking soda
- ¼cup all-purpose flour
- ½cup semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips (chopped or mini chocolate chips)

### Instructions
1. Here’s a peak at how to make this recipe so you know what to expect from the process. Scroll down to the bottom of the post for the full information including the timing and amounts.
2. Rinse and drain the chickpeas.
3. Add to the food processor with the rest of the ingredients except the flour and chocolate chips. Grind well. Pulse in the flour and chocolate.
4. Spread into a pan.
5. Bake until golden around the edges and just firm.
6. No, but I will say that they are best when you make sure to grind up the batter as smooth as possible for the best final texture.
7. You can use sunflower seed butter instead of the peanut butter if you prefer.
8. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. I prefer them chilled, but they are fine at any temperature.
9. Be sure to use a very ripe banana for the best flavor.
10. These are not super sweet, so add up to ¼ cup sugar to the batter if desired.
11. Use honey instead of maple syrup if needed.
12. Use almond butter or sunflower seed butter instead of the peanut butter.
13. Use a gluten-free cup for cup flour blend instead of all purpose if desired.
14. Make them nut-free with sunflower seed butter.
15. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease an 8×8-inch pan with nonstick spray.
16. Add the chickpeas to a colander to drain. Rinse with water. Drain.
17. Add to a food processor with the banana, peanut butter, maple syrup, vanilla, salt, and baking soda. Grind on high to make a uniformly smooth batter. (It might take 15-30 seconds.)
18. Pulse in the flour and chocolate until just combined.
19. Pour batter into the prepared pan and bake for 24-26 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown and the top is firm to the touch.
20. Let cool fully in the pan and slice to serve.
