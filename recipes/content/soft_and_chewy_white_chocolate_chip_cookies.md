# Soft and Chewy White Chocolate Chip Cookies

### Prep Steps

<!-- List prep tasks here -->

### Ingredients
- 1cupbutter (softened)
- ¾cup sugar
- ¾cup brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 2¼cup flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½teaspoon salt
- 1-1½cups white chocolate chips

### Instructions
1. Now, if you like your cookie a little crunchier, you can bake these cookies a tad longer in the oven. A crunchy cookie is great to dunk in milk or in a warm cup of hot chocolate.
2. Would you rather have Macadamia Nuts in them? You could always add them to this recipe or you could try this cookie recipe here.
3. Cream all of the ingredients together.
4. To make this cookie recipe: simply mix sugars, softened butter and egg together in medium bowl. (Remember, my favorite bowl is no more. I still mourn the loss.)
5. Then mix in the dry ingredients. Stir well and put on cookie sheet (ungreased).
6. Then bake and serve. Delicious and easy!
7. Yes, you do. Too little or too much of the brown sugar will drastically result in cookies that don't turn out right. Be sure to measure the brown sugar carefully.
8. I would cook them for 12-15 minutes and go from there.
9. Wait! 365 degrees? Why?
10. Good question! I found that one of the secrets to these cookies is 365 degrees is the perfect. 375 degrees is too high and 350 degrees is too low.
11. I personally think this cookie recipe is the best for soft and chewy cookies and I urge you to try it.
12. You will probably never use another cookie recipe again.
13. Cream together butter, sugars and egg in a large bowl
14. Stir in flour, baking soda and salt
15. Fold in white chocolate chips
16. Roll into 1 inch balls and place on ungreased cookie sheet
17. Bake at 365* for 8 minutes or until done
18. Preheat oven to 365°
