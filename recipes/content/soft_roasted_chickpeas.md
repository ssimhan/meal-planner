# Soft Roasted Chickpeas

### Prep Steps

<!-- List prep tasks here -->

### Ingredients
- US Customary Metric
- 114.5- ounce can chickpeas rinsed, drained, and patted dry (or about 2 cups cooked dried)
- 1 teaspoon canola or coconut oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup or honey
- 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
2. If desired, rub the chickpeas in a clean kitchen towel to remove the skins. (You don’t have to do this, but you may want to if you have a toddler who’s particularly sensitive to textures.) Discard the skins
3. Stir together all ingredients in a medium bowl. Spread on a baking sheet or baking dish and bake for 12-15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature, smashing beans slightly for younger eaters if desired.
