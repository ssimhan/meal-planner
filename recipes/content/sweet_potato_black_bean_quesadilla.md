# Sweet Potato Black Bean Quesadilla

## Ingredients
- 1 large sweet potato
- 1/2 cup frozen corn (or canned corn, drained)
- 1/2 cup cooked black beans (or canned, rinsed and drained)
- 1/2 cup grated cheese (like mozzarella or cheddar)
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
- 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
- Salt to taste
- 4 medium flour tortillas
- 1 tablespoon oil or ghee (for cooking)
- Optional: finely chopped onion, capsicum, green chili, or coriander leaves

## Prep Steps
- Chop onions/shallots

## Instructions
Prep:

Peel and chop 1 sweet potato into small cubes.

Boil or steam the cubes until soft (about 10–15 minutes), then mash well.

If using frozen corn, rinse under warm water to thaw.

Rinse and drain 1/2 cup canned black beans if using.

Optional: Finely chop 1 small onion or capsicum if adding.

🔥 Cook:

Make the filling:

In a bowl, mix the mashed sweet potato, corn, black beans, cumin powder, red chili powder, and salt.

Add any optional veggies or herbs now.

Mix until well combined.

Assemble the quesadillas:

Place one tortilla on a plate or board.

Spread 2–3 tablespoons of the filling on half of the tortilla.

Sprinkle some grated cheese over the filling.

Fold the tortilla in half to close.

Cook the quesadillas:

Heat a pan on medium heat. Add a few drops of oil or ghee.

Place the folded quesadilla in the pan. Cook for 2–3 minutes on each side, until golden brown and the cheese melts.

Repeat with the rest.

Serve:

Cut into wedges and serve hot with chutney, salsa, or curd.
