<!-- List prep tasks here -->

### Ingredients
- AD
- 14.5- ounce can full-fat coconut milk (or coconut cream)

- ½teaspoon vanilla extract

### Instructions
1. AD
2. Spoon the top solid part of the coconut milk into a medium bowl. (Use the remaining liquid part for a future smoothie.) For the result to be super creamy, we want only the firm solids of the coconut milk.
3. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir well to combine thoroughly. Sweeten to taste as you like.
4. Serve the mixture soft with its pudding-like texture or refrigerate briefly to firm up into a more solid mousse.
