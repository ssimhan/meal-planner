# Vegan Lemon Pepper Tofu

### Ingredients
- 1 block extra firm tofu, frozen
- 1/4CupCornstarch
- 2 Tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons lemon pepper seasoning
- 4 garlic cloves
- Salt and pepper
- Steamed Broccoli (optional)
- Pasta (optional)
- Quinoa (optional side)

### Instructions
1. Night before: freeze the block of tofu until completely frozen. This changes the texture.
2. When ready to cook, thaw the tofu completely, then take it out of the package and drain it.
3. Press the tofu for 10-15 minutes to get any excess liquid out while you preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
4. Break the block of tofu into small pieces. The texture will be firm and meaty now so it will break apart into pieces easily.
5. Put the tofu into a large mixing bowl. Then sprinkle with cornstarch onto the tofu and toss to coat.
6. Now drizzle with the olive oil and toss so all of the tofu is wet with oil.
7. Then sprinkle with the lemon pepper and toss to coat. If your lemon pepper seasoning already has salt then you can skip it. If it doesn't have salt, add a few pinches to the bowl with the tofu.
8. Next, add the garlic to the bowl and toss one more time.
9. Place the tofu on a sheet pan, lined with parchment paper or sprayed with non-stick spray.
10. Bake for 10 minutes, flip the tofu and bake for another 10-15 minutes or until brown and crunchy.
11. Serve with any sides you want: steam broccoli, pasta, quinoa, etc.
