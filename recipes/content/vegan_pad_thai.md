### Ingredients
- 3 tablespoon sugar
- 2 tablespoon water
- 2 tablespoon sweet chili sauce
- 2 tablespoon soy sauce
- 3 tablespoon tamarind juice
- 2 tablespoon oil
- 1cloveof garlic minced
- 1 shallot minced
- ½cup scrambled tofu
- 8 ounces rice noodles
- 2cupsbean sprouts
- 6-8 stalks Chinese chives cut into 2-inch long strips
- ¼cup roasted peanuts slightly crushed
- for topping: cilantro, lime juice

### Instructions
1. Pad Thai Sauce
2. Add the sugar to a light-colored saucepan or skillet. Heat over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, or until sugar has melted. Do not stir. Keep heating until the sugar gets a golden brown color and turns into caramel.
3. As soon as the sugar has caramelized, deglaze with the 2 tablespoons of water. Be careful as it will spit. Next, add the vegan fish sauce, sweet chili sauce, soy sauce, tamarind juice, and toasted rice powder if using. Let simmer for 1 minute, or until the caramel has melted. Transfer the sauce to a small bowl and set aside.
4. Pad Thai
5. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, cook the rice noodles according to the package instructions.
6. In the meantime, heat the oil in a skillet or wok over medium heat. Once hot, add the minced garlic and shallot, and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until fragrant.
7. Add the scrambled tofu and cook for another minute. At this point you can add a pinch of turmeric to give the tofu a yellow color, and a pinch of kala namak salt for an eggy taste.
8. Add the drained cooked noodles, bean sprouts, Chinese chives, and the sauce. Cook for 2-3 minute, stirring regularly to coat the noodles with the sauce.
9. Remove from heat, top with crushed peanuts, a squeeze of lime, and serve immediately. This Pad Thai will keep for up to 3 days in the refrigerator.
