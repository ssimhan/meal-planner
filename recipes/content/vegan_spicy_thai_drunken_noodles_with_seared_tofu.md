# Vegan Spicy Thai Drunken Noodles with Seared Tofu

### Prep Steps

<!-- List prep tasks here -->

### Ingredients
- 1 Package Wide Rice Noodle
- 1 package extra firm tofu
- Soy Sauce
- Sriracha
- 1 lime
- 4 Tablespoons Rice Vinegar
- 1/4cupbroth
- 4 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 medium onion
- 6clovesgarlic
- 1cupbasil
- Broccoli (optional)
- Bell pepper (optional)
- Snow peas (optional)
- Carrot (optional)
- Baby corn (optional)

### Instructions
1. PrepPress tofu thoroughly BEFORE cutting into cubes.
2. Mix amino/soy sauce, 2 tablespoons sriracha and lime juice together. Soak the cut tofu cubes in this marinade, cover and refrigerate for an hour.
3. Dice onions. Can also add bell pepper, broccoli, snow peas, carrot, or baby corn.
4. CookPlace all your rice noodles in a wide mixing bowl.
5. Bring 4 cups of water to boil.
6. Pour the boiling water over the rice noodles until they are completely submerged.
7. Stir to loosen the noodles every few minutes so they don't stick together.
8. When they are completely limp, give them a taste to see if they're cooked through.
9. Depending on thickness, the flat rice noodles might take upwards of ten minutes.
10. Pay attention and test the noodles frequently because they'll become mushy if they overcook.
11. The noodles are being stir-fried for the drunken noodles, so you want to under-cook them a bit.
12. They will absorb more moisture and cook the rest once in the stir fry. If your noodles are perfectly cooked to start, they will turn to mush in the stir fry.
13. Once the noodles are tender, drain them and run them under COLD water to stop the cooking.
14. Whisk Drunken Noodle sauce ingredients together (rice vinegar, broth, aminos/soy sauce, maple syrup, sriracha).
15. Pour sauce over noodles and let sit while you cook the tofu.
16. Heat wok to medium-high.
17. Add tofu and sauce, and sear tofu.
18. Put to the side.
19. Add veggies and garlic, and cook until translucent.
20. Add rice noodles, sauce and tofu back in.
21. Add 3/4 cup basil, reserving 1/4 cup for garnish.
22. Add noodles mixture to a bowl.
23. Sprinkle with extra basil.Serve with a wedge of lime and Sriracha
