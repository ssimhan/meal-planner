# Veggie Roti

### Prep Steps

<!-- List prep tasks here -->

### Ingredients
- 1 medium potato or sweet potato
- Wheat flour
- Oil
- Salt
- Ghee
- Saran Wrap

### Instructions
1. Peel and cube the veggie into small chunks for quick steaming and steam until soft (I do this on stove top so I just check using a fork).
2. Once steamed, mash it well using a fork or masher.
3. For the potato roti, heat some oil in a pan, add the mashed potatoes, salt, turmeric powder, kitchen king masala, Kashmiri chilli powder and garlic powder and mix it well for few mins.
4. Transfer this mixture to a bowl, knead it gently while adding wheat flour in small increments, oil, and more salt if needed.
5. Don’t over knead it, it is okay for the dough to be slightly sticky.Don't add any water.
6. You can start mixing using a spoon and then go in with your hand to avoid the mess.
7. For all other veggies, I don’t bring the mash back to the stove, I simply place the mash in a bowl, add the masalas and proceed to the kneading part.
8. Take saran warp and put it on your counter.
9. Oil it slightly - place a fairly big amount of dough ball , cover with another piece of cling wrap and roll into into a slightly thicker disc using a rolling pin.
10. Since the dough will be slightly sticky this method ensures it doesn’t stick when rolling or transferring to the tawa.
11. Transfer to the hot pan , transfer first from foil to hand and then to pan.
12. Roast well on both sides and apply ghee.
