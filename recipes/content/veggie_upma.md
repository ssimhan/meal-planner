# Veggie Upma

### Ingredients
- 1cuprava (semolina/sooji)
- 1 tablespoon oil or ghee
- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1 teaspoon urad dal (optional for a bit of crunch)
- 1 green chili, chopped (optional for mild spice)
- A few curry leaves (if you have them)
- 1smallonion, finely chopped
- ¾ to 1 cup frozen mixed vegetables (like carrot, beans, peas, corn – no need to thaw)
- 2½cups water
- Salt to taste

## Prep Steps
- Chop carrots

### Instructions
1. Prep:Finely chop 1 small onion and 1 green chili (if using).
2. Measure 1 cup rava and 2½ cups water.
3. Keep your frozen veggies ready (no need to thaw).
4. Cook:Heat a pan on medium heat. Add 1 cup rava and dry roast it for 3–4 minutes until it gives off a light nutty smell. Stir continuously so it doesn’t brown. Set aside.
5. In the same or another pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil or ghee. Add 1 teaspoon mustard seeds. Let them pop.
6. Add 1 teaspoon urad dal (if using), 1 chopped green chili, and a few curry leaves. Fry for a few seconds.
7. Add the chopped onion. Sauté until soft and slightly golden.
8. Add ¾ to 1 cup frozen mixed veggies straight into the pan. Cook for 2–3 minutes until they begin to soften.
9. Pour in 2½ cups water and add salt to taste. Bring it to a gentle boil.
10. Reduce the heat to low. Slowly add the roasted rava while stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
11. Stir until the water is absorbed and the upma thickens (about 3–5 minutes). Cover and let it sit for 2 minutes.
12. Mix in chopped coriander, grated coconut, and a splash of lemon juice if you like.
