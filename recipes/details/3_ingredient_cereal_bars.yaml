instructions: 'Here’s a look at how to make this recipe so you know what to expect.
  Scroll down to the end of the post for the full recipe.

  Line an 8×8-inch baking sheet with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on
  two sides (which will make it easy to lift the bars out when it''s time to slice
  them).

  Add the peanut butter and honey to a large heat-safe bowl. Warm in the microwave
  for 15-30 seconds, or until easy to stir. (This may not be necessary if you keep
  your peanut butter and honey at room temperature.) Stir together to combine.

  Add the cereal and vanilla, if using, to the bowl. Stir gently, but thoroughly,
  using a wooden spoon or spatula. It may take a minute or two to get the mixture
  evenly coated.

  Press mixture into the prepared baking pan, gently pressing evenly and into the
  corners.

  Chill for at least 20 minutes. Remove from the fridge, lift out using the parchment
  paper, and slice on a cutting board.

  Wrap each bar in plastic wrap (optional) and store in an airtight container in the
  fridge. Serve cold.'
