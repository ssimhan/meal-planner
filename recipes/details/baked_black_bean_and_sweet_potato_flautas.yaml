prep_steps: []
cook_steps:
- Pre-heat your oven to 425F.
- Poke a few holes in your sweet potato, wrap it in a slightly damp paper towel, and
  microwave on high for about 6-8 minutes. The paper towel trick keeps the potato
  moist
- While you wait, combine corn, diced or minced peppers, and diced or minced onion
  with your black beans, garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, cilantro, cayenne, and
  taco sauce/salsa.
- If you prefer very tender veggies, feel free to saute the vegetables first in a
  little butter or oil to tenderize.
- Your cayenne and red pepper flakes will control the spice-factor; adjust those to
  taste.
- I alternate between using my favorite flavorful red enchilada sauce, spicy taco
  sauce, and a natural, zesty salsa like Mrs. Renfros Green Salsa, all have produced
  delicious results!
- Once your sweet potato is cooked, fluff the inside with a fork and add the flesh
  [minus the skin] to the rest of your veggies and mix thoroughly.
- Add salt, pepper, and any additional seasoning to taste. I usually add a little
  extra sprinkle chili powder, cumin, and garlic!
- Next, working in small batches of maybe 3-4 tortillas, wrap corn tortillas in a
  damp paper towel and microwave on high for 30 seconds. Follow it up with an additional
  30 seconds, if needed.
- The goal here is to steam the tortillas so they roll into perfect flautas without
  breaking or cracking =) This trick works like a charm!
- Immediately spray or rub one side each tortilla with oil and add "line" of veggie
  filling to the center of the "dry side" of each tortilla, about 1-inch thick.
- Top it off with a layer of cheese [as much or as little as you want! if you're using
  cream cheese as well you can mix it into the shredded cheese before topping] and
  roll the tortilla.
- Place on a wire baking/cooling rack and seal with a toothpick, if needed.
- Repeat these steps until you have a rack full of flautas.
- Give them one more teeny spritz of olive oil to get them extra crispy [no-frying!
  whoo!] and set the rack baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.
- The wire rack elevates the flautas and allows them to get nice and crispy on both
  sides. If you don't own a wire rack, simply place the flautas on aluminum foil after
  spraying and turn over halfway through cooking so both sides will get a chance to
  crisp up. Uber easy!
- Bake on the middle rack, at 425F, for 15 minutes.
- At the end, set to broil on HIGH for just under a minute to crisp the tortillas
  into a perfectly golden, crunchy shell.
- Pile high with any + all veggies you have on hand and serve with plain greek yogurt,
  salsa, and guacamole for dipping! You can even whip up a small bowl of jalapeno
  ranch for dunking too! If you have any fresh lime or cilantro both will make a tasty
  garnish!
