instructions: 'Put all ingredients into a medium pot and bring to a complete boil,
  then cover and simmer 15 minutes or until the cauliflower is fall-apart tender.

  Pulverize with either an immersion or regular blender.

  Serve over pasta, or spaghetti squash, rice, roasted vegetables, or whatever you
  wish.

  Makes about 2 cups, and it gets much thicker as it sits.'
