instructions: 'Chop 1 large onion and 2 tomatoes (or 1 can of diced tomatoes). Drain
  and rinse 2 cans of chickpeas.

  Turn on the Instant Pot and select the ''Sauté'' function.

  Add 2 tablespoons of ghee and let it heat up.

  Add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.

  Add the finely chopped onions to the Instant Pot and sauté until golden brown.

  Add the minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies (if using). Cook for 1-2 minutes
  until fragrant.

  Add the chopped tomatoes (or canned diced tomatoes) and cook until they become soft
  and the oil starts to separate from the mixture.

  Stir in the ground coriander, ground cumin, turmeric powder, paprika, and chili
  powder. Cook for another 2 minutes.

  Add the drained and rinsed chickpeas to the Instant Pot. Mix well to coat the chickpeas
  with the spice mixture.

  Add about 1 cup of water to the Instant Pot. Stir well.

  Secure the lid on the Instant Pot, making sure the valve is set to ''Sealing''.

  Select the ''Manual'' or ''Pressure Cook'' function and set the timer for 5 minutes.

  Once the cooking cycle is complete, let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes,
  then carefully turn the valve to ''Venting'' to release any remaining pressure.

  Open the Instant Pot and sprinkle 1 teaspoon of garam masala over the chana masala.
  Stir well and adjust salt to taste.'
