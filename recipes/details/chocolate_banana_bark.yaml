instructions: 'Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper. Add banana slices to
  the parchment in rows to make a rectangle shape. You want to make sure all your
  banana slices are touching.

  Use a spoon to spread peanut butter over the banana slices to make a peanut butter
  layer. Pop the baking sheet into the freezer for about 20 minutes to let the bananas
  and peanut butter harden a bit.

  Place chocolate chips and the coconut oil into a microwave safe bowl and melt in
  the microwave in 30 second increments, stirring between each. It shouldn''t take
  longer than 1-2 minutes total.

  Drizzle melted chocolate over top of the peanut butter and use a spoon or spread
  the chocolate into a thin layer. Sprinkle on the flaky sea salt and place back in
  the freezer until chocolate has set, about 20 minutes or so.

  Remove from the freezer, break or cut into pieces and enjoy! Store any leftover
  bark in the freezer for up to a month.'
