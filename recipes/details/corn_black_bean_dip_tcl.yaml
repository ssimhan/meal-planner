instructions: 'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

  Cook the corn in microwave.

  Dice bell peppers, serranos, scallions.

  Melt 1 tbsp oil and 2 tablespoon of the butter in a large heavy skillet over medium-high
  heat and add the diced serranos/jalapenos and let splutter for a few seconds then
  add the red and green peppers.

  Add pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, on medium to low heat until the
  peppers are softened (about 7-8 minutes).

  Prep the oven safe dish and aluminum foil.

  Add the corn, garlic, red chili, cumin powder, oregano and stir to incorporate well.
  Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to let the corn mix with the spices
  and soften a bit. Add Black beans, cilantro, siracha, stir and remove from heat.
  Add mayonnaise (or sour cream substitute), milk, and shredded cheese and mix well.

  Transfer to oven safe baking dish, cover with foil and let bake for 20 minutes on
  the middle rack until you see the edges of the dip bubbling.

  Remove from oven, top with scallions and serve hot with tortilla chips! If you want
  to get a golden brown crust on top - add an additional layer of shredded cheese
  on top and broil on low for a few minutes until the cheese has browned.'
