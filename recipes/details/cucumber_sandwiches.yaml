ingredients:
- 16 slices bread
- Garlic
- Salt and black pepper
- 1 English cucumber
- Lemon juice
- 8 ounces cream cheese
- Chives
- Dill
prep_steps:
- Peel the cucumber in stripes and cut into 1/8-inch thin slices using a mandolin
  or sharp knife. Place the slices on paper towels and sprinkle with coarse salt.
  Let rest for 15-30 minutes to extract moisture. Pat dry with clean paper towels.
cook_steps:
- In the meantime, make the spread. In a medium bowl, using a handheld mixer, blend
  together the softened cream cheese, mayo, dill, chives, lemon juice, garlic powder,
  and salt.
- Spread one side of each slice of bread with the herbed cream cheese.
- Layer cucumber slices over half of the bread slices. Season with fresh cracked black
  pepper, to taste. Top with remaining bread slices, cream cheese mixture down. (At
  this point, you'll have 8 full sandwiches.)
- Using a sharp Chef's knife, cut each sandwich into quarters, pushing through the
  bread down to the bottom. So you have 32 tea sandwiches.
- Serve right away and enjoy!
- To Make Ahead“One day before, the sandwiches were made and cut and layered with
  damp doubled paper towels in a fish bin (or on a sheet pan, and then saran wrapped)
  and refrigerated.”
