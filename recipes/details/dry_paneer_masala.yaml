prep_steps: []
cook_steps:
- In a large pot over medium high heat add the oil. Once the oil is hot add the cumin
  seeds and let them splutter for a few seconds.
- Add the diced onions and cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes until the onions
  are golden. I like to add a pinch of salt to the onions to help them cook faster.
- Now add the garlic, ginger, and all the spices except for Kasuri methi, red bell
  peppers, green bell peppers and mix well. Stir this for about 2 minutes so everything
  has a chance to mix well and then add 1/2 cup of water , mix well and place a lid
  on the pot. Reduce heat to low and let this cook covered for about 10 minutes.
- Remove the lid and give everything a good mix and now add the cubed paneer, corn,
  cilantro, kasuri methi and salt. Stir and taste for salt- adjust as needed. Place
  a lid on the pot and let it cook for an additional 5 minutes!
- Serve hot with paratha and or rice!
