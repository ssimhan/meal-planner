  Best Tips for Success

  I prefer to roll the dough out between parchment paper since it’s easy, but you
  can also do it by coating the rolling pin with a little flour to prevent sticking.

  You can use all-purpose flour if you prefer or if that’s what you have. I like the
  flavor from whole-wheat, but both will work.

  We like to make them using mini cookie cutters, but any size will work.

  Store leftovers in an airtight container for 3-5 days at room temperature.

  You can also store any dough you don’t use in a zip top plastic bag, tightly sealed
  and with as much air removed as possible, for up to a week in the fridge. Let sit
  at room temperature for about 30 minutes before using.

  AD

  Preheat the oven to 375°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

  Place all ingredients into a bowl and use your hand to mix together to form a dough.
  (If the dough is a little crumbly, be sure that it’s throughly combined and then
  if it’s still crumbly, add 1/2-1 tablespoon additional milk until it comes together.)

  Make a flattened disc of dough.

  Roll the dough ¼-inch thick between two pieces of lightly floured pieces of parchment
  paper. (The flour will ensure that the cut outs are easy to move.)

  Cut out the dough with a cookie cutter and transfer to the prepared baking sheets.
  Bake for 7-9 minutes, until lightly browned around the edges.

  Remove from the oven, let cool on the baking sheet for a minute, and transfer to
  a wire rack to cool completely.'
