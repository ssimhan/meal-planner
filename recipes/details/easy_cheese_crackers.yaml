instructions: 'Add all ingredients to the food processor.

  Blend until it sticks together into a batter. You may need to pulse it a few times,
  as the mixture is a thick batter.

  Roll out the dough between two pieces of parchment paper coated with a little flour
  to prevent it from sticking.

  Use cookie cutters, a knife, or a pastry wheel to cut out crackers.

  Place onto a parchment-lined baking sheet or use a silicone baking mat.

  Bake until golden brown.

  How to Keep Homemade Crackers Crisp

  These crackers are best eaten soon after they come out of the oven—they small so
  good I don’t know how you’d resist!—but you can store them in an airtight container
  at room temperature for up to a day or two.

  They start to soften as they sit, so if you’re worried about eating the whole batch,
  make half and store the rest of the dough in a zip-top bag in the fridge or freezer,
  and when ready to make more, bring the dough to room temp and bake!

  How to Store

  These crackers are best eaten on the day they’re made, but you can store them in
  an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two.

  Best Tips for Success

  To make these gluten-free, use gluten-free flour blend and certified gluten-free
  rolled oats.

  Use the rosemary to add a little extra flavor, or omit it if you prefer. Or try
  garlic powder or black pepper for other flavor variations.

  If your dough is sticky at any point, place it into the fridge for a few minutes
  to firm up. If your dough seems to not come together when it’s in the food processor,
  add a few additional drops of milk.

  Set the timer for the lower end of the baking range to start, then add another minute
  until the edges are lightly golden brown. The edges can get very brown really fast
  at the end.

  To make a smaller batch, place half of the dough into a freezer storage bag, seal,
  and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature, roll out, cut out shapes,
  and bake whenever the urge strikes!

  Dairy-free: Use nondairy cheese and softened coconut oil in place of the cheese
  and butter.

  Gluten-free: Use a 1:1 style of gluten-free flour blend like the one from King Arthur
  Flour.

  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

  Add all ingredients to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse a few times to grind,
  then blend for 15-20 seconds until dough comes together.

  Form the dough into a disc. Dust a piece of parchment with flour, place the dough
  on top, and add another piece of parchment to cover.

  Roll out until ¼ inch thick. Cut with small cookie cutters and place on the prepared
  baking sheet. Re-roll and cut remaining dough until completed.

  (If your milk, cheese, and butter are cold the dough should be easy to roll out
  between parchment paper. If the dough seems too sticky, stick it into the fridge
  for 5-10 minutes.)

  Bake 14-16 minutes or until crackers are golden. Cool for a few minutes on a wire
  rack before serving.

  Store in an airtight container for up to 2 days at room temperature.'
