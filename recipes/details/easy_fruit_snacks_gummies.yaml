  AD

  Add the berries, carrots, and water or juice to a blender. Puree smooth.

  Add the berry mixture to a small pot set over low heat. Add the honey or maple syrup.
  Bring to a simmer.

  (Plan to do this step and the next one quickly.) Add the gelatin to a bowl with
  ⅓ cup cold water. Stir well to completely dissolve the gelatin to ensure the fruit
  snacks are lump-free.

  Working quickly, whisk the gelatin mixture into the simmering fruit mixture to thoroughly
  combine. Whisk constantly for a minute or two as the mixture starts to thicken.
  Turn off the heat.

  (Alternatively, you can sprinkle the gelatin right over the simmering fruit and
  whisk vigorously to combine. Omit the water if you do that. Know you may have some
  small clumps of gelatin.)

  Portion out into a silicone gummy bear mold (or other silicone mold) set on a small
  baking tray (which is more stable than the mold on its own). Refrigerate for at
  least an hour and up to overnight to set up.

  Remove from the mold to serve.'
