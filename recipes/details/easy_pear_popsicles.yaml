  recipe so you know what to expect from the process. Plan to start this 4-6 hours
  before you want to serve them so they have time to freeze.

  Freeze for at least 4 hours or overnight. Release from the popsicle mold and serve.

  Best Tips for Success

  Transfer the frozen popsicles to a freezer bag, remove as much air as possible,
  and seal. Freeze for up to 6 months.

  Blend smooth in a blender if you prefer to have a completely smooth popsicle, though
  know that just chopping them yields a pretty smooth result, too.
