cook_steps:
- This sauce comes together quickly once you get started, so measure the dry ingredients
  (the flour, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt and optional cinnamon)
  into a small bowl and place it near the stove. Place the tomato paste and broth
  near the stove as well.
- In a medium-sized pot over medium heat, warm the oil until it’s hot enough that
  a light sprinkle of the flour/spice mixture sizzles on contact. This might take
  a couple of minutes, so be patient and don’t step away from the stove!
- Once it’s ready, pour in the flour and spice mixture. While whisking constantly,
  cook until fragrant and slightly deepened in color, about 1 minute. Whisk the tomato
  paste into the mixture, then slowly pour in the broth while whisking constantly
  to remove any lumps.
- Raise heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat as
  necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, whisking often, for about 5 to 7 minutes,
  until the sauce has thickened a bit and a spoon encounters some resistance as you
  stir it. (The sauce will thicken some more as it cools.)
- Remove from heat, then whisk in the vinegar and season to taste with a generous
  amount of freshly ground black pepper. Add more salt, if necessary (I usually add
  another pinch or two). Go forth and make enchiladas!
- 'STORAGE SUGGESTIONS: Extra enchilada sauce will keep well in the refrigerator for
  up to 5 days. Or, freeze it for up to 3 months. Let it cool to room temperature
  before transferring to a wide-mouth mason jar, leaving some room at the top for
  expansion (don’t screw on the lid completely until the mixture is fully frozen),
  or a freezer bag (remove excess air before sealing).'
