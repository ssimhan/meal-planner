instructions: 'Melt the butter in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium
  heat.

  Once melted, add the corn and the salt (if using frozen corn, no need to defrost
  first). Cook, stirring just every minute or so, until the corn is warmed through
  and turning golden on the edges, about 5 to 8 minutes (turn the heat down to low
  if the corn starts jumping out of the pan).

  Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds, then remove the skillet
  from the heat.

  Let the corn cool for a few minutes, then transfer it to a medium mixing bowl.

  Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl (the mayonnaise, optional jalapeño, lime
  juice, chili powder, optional cayenne, cheese and cilantro). Stir to combine.

  Season to taste with additional salt, if needed.

  To serve, divide the mixture between small cups and garnish individual servings
  with a wedge of lime, perhaps a sprinkle of additional cheese and chili powder.
  Leftovers keep well, refrigerated, for about 4 days.'
