  and turning golden on the edges, about 5 to 8 minutes (turn the heat down to low
  if the corn starts jumping out of the pan).

  from the heat.
- Let the corn cool for a few minutes, then transfer it to a medium mixing bowl.
- Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl (the mayonnaise, optional jalapeño, lime
  juice, chili powder, optional cayenne, cheese and cilantro). Stir to combine.
- Season to taste with additional salt, if needed.
- To serve, divide the mixture between small cups and garnish individual servings
  with a wedge of lime, perhaps a sprinkle of additional cheese and chili powder.
