instructions: 'Prep:Preheat the oven to 400°F.

  Grease a muffin tin, making sure to coat the top edges of each cup (cheese may spill
  over).

  Stretch the pizza dough into an 11x16-inch rectangle on a piece of parchment paper
  (this will prevent sticking). If the dough is too tough to stretch, let it rest
  for 5 minutes and try again.

  Chop the spinach if it''s not pre-chopped.

  Cook:Spread the Toppings: Spread pizza sauce over the dough. Sprinkle on the spinach,
  mozzarella, and Parmesan evenly.

  Roll the Dough: Starting on one long side, roll the dough up into a log, using the
  parchment paper to help you roll.

  Slice: Cut the rolled dough into 12 even slices using a serrated knife. To make
  it easier, start cutting in the center, then work on cutting each half evenly.

  Bake: Place each slice into the greased muffin tin. Bake for 22-26 minutes, or until
  the dough is baked through, the cheese is melted, and the tops are golden brown.

  Cool: Let the rolls cool in the muffin tin for 3-5 minutes to let the cheese firm
  up. Use a knife to loosen any stuck cheese before transferring them to a wire rack
  or serving plate.

  Storage:Fridge: Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.Freezer:
  Freeze in a zip-lock bag for up to 3 months. To reheat, microwave frozen rolls for
  30-60 seconds or until warm.'
