instructions: 'Add the milk to the blender. (We prefer nondairy milks since they seem
  to have a slightly better consistency and less of a tendency to separate after blending.)

  Add the fruit and veggie.

  Add any optional ingredients.

  Blend the smoothie really well to ensure that it has a very creamy texture.

  Serve it in a reusable pouch, a small open cup, or in a sippy cup depending on what
  your kid likes best.

  AD

  Add chosen ingredients to a blender.

  Blend until very smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl and adding
  more liquid if needed.

  Serve immediately.'
