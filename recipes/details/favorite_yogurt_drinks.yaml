instructions: 'Here’s a look at how to make this kids drink. (I should add that I
  love it for myself, too!) Scroll down to the end of this post for the full information.

  Choose your flavor and gather your ingredients.

  Add all ingredients to a blender.

  Blend well, starting on low speed and working up to high. If your blender came with
  a stick, use that to help move the mixture around as needed. If the mixture is having
  a hard time blending, add 2 tablespoons milk.

  Serve or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

  AD

  Add the ingredients to the blender.

  Blend, starting on low and working up to high to blend very smooth.

  (If your blender came with a stick, use it to help get the mixture moving if needed.
  If the mixture is ever challenging to blend, add 2 tablespoons milk.)

  Sweeten to taste as desired using the honey or maple syrup.

  Serve or store for a future meal.

  Banana-Cauliflower: Use 1 cup sliced very ripe banana and ¼ cup raw fresh or frozen
  cauliflower.

  Use whole milk Greek yogurt for the creamiest texture. Regular yogurt will work,
  though it will be a little less creamy.

  Blend the ingredients, taste, then sweeten with honey (for kids over age 1) or maple
  syrup to taste. Sweetness can vary considerably in fruit.

  Use fresh or frozen fruit. If you use frozen fruit and the mixture is a little difficult
  to blend, add 2 tablespoons milk.

  Add 1 tablespoon hemp seeds for additional healthy fats and protein, if desired.

  Dairy-free: Use nondairy yogurt or kefir. This also works with lactose-free options.

  Serve in a reusable pouch, a Smoothie Cup, or a small open cup as you like.'
