instructions: 'Below is an overview of this recipe so you know what to expect. Scroll
  to the end of the post for the details on amounts and timing.

  Place the cashews into a medium bowl and cover with hot water. Let sit to soften.
  Drain. (This helps the nuts soften enough to grind into the batter.)

  Add the drained nuts to a food processor with the rest of the ingredients.

  Grind into a batter, starting on low and working up to high. (You will likely need
  to let the machine run for about a minute until the batter starts to hold together
  like cookie dough.) Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl if needed to help
  the mixture move thoroughly.

  Press into a silicone mold (I use a 1 cup Souper Cube) or an 8×8-inch baking pan
  lined with parchment paper. Refrigerate briefly, then slice into bars.

  Place the cashews into a medium bowl and cover with hot water. Let sit for at least
