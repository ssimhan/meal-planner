instructions: 'Cut a circle in each slice of bread, so it has a large hole in it.

  Over medium heat, heat greased skillet.

  Put bread on the skillet and crack an egg into the hole. Break yolk, if desired.

  Once the egg is mostly cooked, flip bread and cook through.

  Serve with the circle as a piece of plain bread or toast.'
