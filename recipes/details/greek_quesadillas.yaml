instructions: 'Thinly slice the spinach, red onion and olives. Chop the fresh oregano
  (if using).

  For each quesadilla, place a tortilla on a plate and evenly spread with ¼ of the
  spinach, red onion, olives, mozzarella cheese, feta cheese, and oregano. Sprinkle
  with a few red pepper flakes (if using).

  Heat a large non-stick skillet* over medium heat for a few minutes. Place the loaded
  tortilla on the griddle and place another tortilla on top. Cook until browned on
  the bottom, then flip and cook until browned on the other side, a few minutes per
  side.

  Remove the tortilla and cut into wedges with a pizza cutter. If making several quesadillas
  at once, keep them warm in a 300°F oven.'
