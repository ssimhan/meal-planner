instructions: 'Spread a thin layer of butter on one side of each slice of bread.

  (Optional) Sprinkle a pinch of garlic powde inside the sandwich for added flavor.

  Place one slice of bread, buttered side down, on the preheated pan.

  Add the cheese slices on top, along with a slice of tomato if desired, then cover
  with the second slice of bread, buttered side up.

  Cook on medium heat for about 2-3 minutes on one side, pressing gently with a spatula,
  until golden brown.

  Flip carefully and cook the other side for another 2-3 minutes until the bread is
  crispy and the cheese is fully melted.

  Pour the Trader Joe''s tomato soup into a small pot or microwave-safe bowl.

  Heat on the stovetop for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or microwave for 2-3
  minutes.

  For a creamier soup, stir in a splash of milk or cream while heating.

  Cut the grilled cheese in half (diagonally for a classic touch!).

  Pour the hot tomato soup into a bowl.

  Pair your sandwich with the soup and enjoy dipping for extra flavor.'
