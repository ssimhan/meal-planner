instructions: 'Cut the avocados, score and mash in the bowl.

  Sprinkle with salt and lime (or lemon) juice.

  Add the chopped onion, cilantro, black pepper.

  If making a few hours ahead, place plastic wrap on the surface of the guacamole
  and press down to cover it to prevent air reaching it. (The oxygen in the air causes
  oxidation which will turn the guacamole brown.)

  Refrigerate leftover guacamole up to 3 days.'
