instructions: 'Here’s a look at making this coconut rice so you know what to expect
  from the process. Scroll down to see the full recipe at the bottom of the post.

  AD

  Place the rice into a medium bowl and fill with water. Swirl and pour off the cloudy
  liquid. Repeat a few more times until the water is mostly clear.

  Add the coconut oil to a medium pot placed over medium heat. Grate the ginger, if
  using, with a fine microplane into the warm oil. Stir and cook for about a minute.
  Stir in the rice to coat.

  Add water and bring to a simmer. Cook until the water is almost all absorbed.

  Stir in the coconut milk. Cook until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is soft.
  Remove from heat and cover. Let sit and stir in the shredded coconut, if using.
  (I recommend you use it!) Serve warm.
