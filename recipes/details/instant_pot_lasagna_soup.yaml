instructions: 'Dice the onion, bell pepper and spinach.

  Set your IP to saute mode and add two tablespoons of oil. Once the oil is hot, add
  the serrano chilis, oregano and garlic and let splutter for a few moments.

  Add the onions and peppers and continue to cook for 5 minutes.

  Prepare the broth (4 cups) + 1 extra cup of water.

  Once the onions and peppers have softened, add in the rao''s sauce, spinach, vegetable
  broth, 1 cup water, scallions, cilantro, and parsley.

  Stir well for a few minutes until all the ingredients are incorporated.

  Add in the pasta (4-5 cups)

  Hit cancel on the IP and switch it to Pressure Cook on High Mode. Cut the cooking
  time on the box in half for the pressure cook time (box said 6 minutes to al dente-
  so I cooked the pasta for 3 minutes).

  After it cooks, immediately do a quick release.

  The consistency should be soupy.

  If it is too thick- add water in one cup increments until you reach the desired
  consistency.

  If your pasta is undercooked- just set it on saute mode and let it simmer until
  the pasta cooks.

  Add in the mozzarella. No additional salt needed.'
