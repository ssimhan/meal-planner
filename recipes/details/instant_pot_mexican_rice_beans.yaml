prep_steps: []
cook_steps:
- Turn the Instant Pot on saute mode and add 2 tbsp of oil. Once the oil is hot, add
  the green chilis and white parts of the scallions. Let them splutter for about 30
  seconds or so and then add the diced onions.
- Saute the onions for about 2-3 minutes until they are slightly soft. Hit cancel
  to turn the IP off and then immediately add the rinsed rice, salt, garlic, taco
  seasoning, chili powder, and cumin powder. Stir for about 2 minutes until garlic
  is fragrant but not browned.
- Add the broth, and use a spatula to scrape up and browned bits of spices stuck to
  the pot (be sure to do this well so you don't get a BURN notice on your IP. Once
  you've added the broth, stir well.
- Next, add the salsa into the IP but do not mix it it in, just place it in the center
  right over the rice and do not touch it.
- Place your lid on the IP and set the IP to High Pressure Cook Mode and set the timer
  for 4 minutes. Once the IP beeps (and the pressure cooking phase is complete) quick
  release after 10 minutes.
- Open the IP and use a fork to fluff and mix the rice very gently. Mixing the rice
  too vigourously at this stage will break the rice up and make it mushy. Let the
  rice sit for about 5 minutes. Next add in the pinto beans, corn and remaining green
  parts of the scallions. Taste for salt and adjust as needed.
- Serve as a side, topped with shredded lettuce, pico de gallo and a dollop of sour
  cream.
