instructions: 'Add kidney beans and water to the Instant Pot and stir to prevent sticking.

  Pressure cook on high (40 minutes for more firm, 45 for more tender)

  It take about 8 minutes for the Instant Pot to pressurize before cooking begins.

  Allow to naturally release for 15 minutes, then release any remaining pressure.

  Carefully remove lid once steam has fully escaped and strain off any excess cooking
  liquid.

  Store cooled leftovers in the refrigerator up to 5 days or in the freezer up to
  1 month.

  Reheat in a saucepan on the stovetop, adding a little water, as needed, to prevent
  sticking.'
