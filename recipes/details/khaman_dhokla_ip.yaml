instructions: "Prepare Khaman Batter:\nMix in all of the ingredients, except the Eno\
  \ fruit salt \u2013 gram flour, semolina, turmeric, salt, sugar, green chili, ginger,\
  \ lime juice, oil and water. Stir to combine well and let the batter sit for 15\
  \ minutes.\nWhile the batter is resting, boil 2 cups water in the pressure cooker\
  \ on saut\xE9 mode. Also, grease the steel pan in which you will make the khaman\
  \ with oil. I used one container from the stackable steel containers for the instant\
  \ pot.\nAfter 15 minutes, add Eno to the batter and stir it gently in one direction.\
  \ The batter will become frothy and increase in volume. Do not over stir.\nQuickly\
  \ transfer the batter to the greased steel container and place the container on\
  \ a trivet. It is important to start cooking quickly after adding Eno to get soft\
  \ and fluffy Khaman.\nSteaming in Instant Pot\nThen place the trivet along with\
  \ the pan in the instant pot. Set to Steam mode for 15 mins in venting mode. The\
  \ instant pot timer does not work in venting mode, hence you will need to set an\
  \ external timer.\nAfter the cooking time is done, let the khaman sit for 5 minutes.\
  \ Then open the lid of the instant pot and take out the khaman using tongs.\nLet\
  \ it cool for 5 more minutes, so it is easy to remove. Insert a knife or toothpick\
  \ to check it is cooked. The knife should come out almost clean. If not, you will\
  \ need to steam for 2-3 more minutes.\nRun a knife around the edges of the khaman.\
  \ Place a plate on top of the container and turn it upside down. This will help\
  \ to get the khaman out of the container easily.\nPrepare Tempering\nWhile the khaman\
  \ is steaming in the instant pot, heart oil in a pan on stovetop on high heat.\n\
  Then add the mustard seeds and let them sizzle. Now add the curry leaves. Let them\
  \ saut\xE9 for about 30 seconds. Add the sesame seeds and turn off heat.\nNow add\
  \ water, sugar, salt and stir well.\nCut the khaman into small pieces. Spread the\
  \ tempering over it.\nGarnish with chopped cilantro and serve with green mint chutney."
