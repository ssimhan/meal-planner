prep_steps:
- 'Prepare Khaman Batter:'
cook_steps:
- Mix in all of the ingredients, except the Eno fruit salt – gram flour, semolina,
  turmeric, salt, sugar, green chili, ginger, lime juice, oil and water. Stir to combine
  well and let the batter sit for 15 minutes.
- While the batter is resting, boil 2 cups water in the pressure cooker on sauté mode.
  Also, grease the steel pan in which you will make the khaman with oil. I used one
  container from the stackable steel containers for the instant pot.
- After 15 minutes, add Eno to the batter and stir it gently in one direction. The
  batter will become frothy and increase in volume. Do not over stir.
- Quickly transfer the batter to the greased steel container and place the container
  on a trivet. It is important to start cooking quickly after adding Eno to get soft
  and fluffy Khaman.
- Steaming in Instant Pot
- Then place the trivet along with the pan in the instant pot. Set to Steam mode for
  15 mins in venting mode. The instant pot timer does not work in venting mode, hence
  you will need to set an external timer.
- After the cooking time is done, let the khaman sit for 5 minutes. Then open the
  lid of the instant pot and take out the khaman using tongs.
- Let it cool for 5 more minutes, so it is easy to remove. Insert a knife or toothpick
  to check it is cooked. The knife should come out almost clean. If not, you will
  need to steam for 2-3 more minutes.
- Run a knife around the edges of the khaman. Place a plate on top of the container
  and turn it upside down. This will help to get the khaman out of the container easily.
- Prepare Tempering
- While the khaman is steaming in the instant pot, heart oil in a pan on stovetop
  on high heat.
- Then add the mustard seeds and let them sizzle. Now add the curry leaves. Let them
  sauté for about 30 seconds. Add the sesame seeds and turn off heat.
- Now add water, sugar, salt and stir well.
- Cut the khaman into small pieces. Spread the tempering over it.
- Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with green mint chutney.
