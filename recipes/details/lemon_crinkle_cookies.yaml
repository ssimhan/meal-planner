prep_steps: []
cook_steps:
- In a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, cornstarch, and salt. Set aside.
- Zest the lemon into a small bowl. And press the lemon juice into a separate bowl.
- Using a mixer, beat the butter and sugar on high speed for 3-4 minutes. It should
  be soft and pale. Scrape the bowl using a rubber spatula.
- Add in the lemon zest, lemon juice, vanilla and egg replacer. Mix on medium until
  combined. Add in the yellow gel food dye if desired. I added 3 drops.
- Add in the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until just combined. Add in the white
  chocolate chips and mix on low.
- Cover dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to
  2 days. Chilling is required for this sticky cookie dough.
- Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator.
- Preheat the oven to 350℉. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Let the cookie
  dough rest for 10 minutes. This helps to prevent too much spread.
- Place the sugar in one bowl and the powdered sugar in another bowl. Use a small
  cookie scoop (1 oz or 1 Tablespoon) and scoop the dough. Place 12 cookie dough balls
  per cookie sheet.
- Roll the cookie dough ball in the sugar first. Then, roll in the powdered sugar.
  Make sure it has a thick coat of powdered sugar.
- Once all rolled, bake for 11-13 minutes. Bake until the edges are set. Make sure
  to not over bake these, otherwise they will be dry and the powdered sugar will melt.
- Cool the cookies on the hot pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.
