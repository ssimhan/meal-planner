instructions: "In a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, cornstarch, and salt.\
  \ Set aside.\nZest the lemon into a small bowl. And press the lemon juice into a\
  \ separate bowl.\nUsing a mixer, beat the butter and sugar on high speed for 3-4\
  \ minutes. It should be soft and pale. Scrape the bowl using a rubber spatula.\n\
  Add in the lemon zest, lemon juice, vanilla and egg replacer. Mix on medium until\
  \ combined. Add in the yellow gel food dye if desired. I added 3 drops.\nAdd in\
  \ the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until just combined. Add in the white chocolate\
  \ chips and mix on low.\nCover dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at\
  \ least 1 hour and up to 2 days. Chilling is required for this sticky cookie dough.\n\
  Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u2109. Line\
  \ two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Let the cookie dough rest for 10 minutes.\
  \ This helps to prevent too much spread.\nPlace the sugar in one bowl and the powdered\
  \ sugar in another bowl. Use a small cookie scoop (1 oz or 1 Tablespoon) and scoop\
  \ the dough. Place 12 cookie dough balls per cookie sheet.\nRoll the cookie dough\
  \ ball in the sugar first. Then, roll in the powdered sugar. Make sure it has a\
  \ thick coat of powdered sugar.\nOnce all rolled, bake for 11-13 minutes. Bake until\
  \ the edges are set. Make sure to not over bake these, otherwise they will be dry\
  \ and the powdered sugar will melt.\nCool the cookies on the hot pan for 5 minutes\
  \ before transferring to a cooling rack."
