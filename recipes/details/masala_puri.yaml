  Boil potatoes until tender, peel and mash them. Set aside.
  
  Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat.
  Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Let them splutter.
  
  Add chopped onions and garlic, sauté until golden brown (5-6 minutes).
  
  Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and become mushy (5-7 minutes).
  
  Add turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well.
  
  Add mashed potatoes and mix thoroughly. Cook for 3-4 minutes.
  Add a little water if the mixture is too thick. It should be slightly saucy.
  
  Add chopped cilantro and mix well. Adjust seasoning to taste.
  
  To serve: Place puris on a plate, top with the hot masala mixture.
  Optionally garnish with sev, extra chopped onions, cilantro, and chutneys.

notes: Classic Indian street food. The masala can be made ahead and reheated. Puris are best fresh and crispy.
