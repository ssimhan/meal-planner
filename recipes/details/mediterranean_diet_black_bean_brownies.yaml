instructions: 'Preheat your oven to 350 and prep an baking dish (9 X 13 works well)
  for nonstick. Parchment paper should work in this recipe.

  Rinse the black beans if you have not already done in cool water. Then allow the
  beans to drain.

  In a medium mixing bowl whisk or mix together the unsweetened cocoa powder, baking
  powder, and flour.

  Next, use a food processor or good blender process together the beans and the chocolate
  chips until blended together. Then add the banana, syrup, and oil and continue to
  process.

  Add the dry ingredients from the first bowl, along with the vanilla extract, to
  the processor and process until smooth. The stir in the chopped nuts.

  Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish. Top with any desired extra chocolate
  chips and nuts. Bake for 20-25 minutes. Then allow the brownies to cool on a rack
  before cutting.'
