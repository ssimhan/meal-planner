prep_steps:
- Quick Soak Sabudana
cook_steps:
- Heat 2-3 cups of water until it is boiling hot. It’s convenient to do this in a
  hot water kettle or right on the stove.
- Rinse the sabudana thoroughly (wash about 2-3 times until you get clear liquid).
  Drain the liquid and place in a deep bowl.
- Pour 1.5 cups of the hot water on top of the sabudana and let it sit for 30 minutes.
- After 30 minutes, press a few of the sabudana between your fingers- they should
  be soft.
- Drain the sabudana , rinse with cold water and transfer the sabudana to a wide colander
  or spread out in a large pan until the sabudana is completely dry (about 15-20 minutes).
- Directions
- In a large pot, heat the oil over medium high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the
  cumin seeds and scallion whites and stir.
- Next add the bell peppers, turmeric, chili powder, taco seasoning and cook on low
  heat until the bell peppers are soft.
- Once the peppers are soft, add the garlic and salt.
- Add the sabudana, cilantro, lime juice, green scallions and mix until everything
  is well combined.I like my sabudana a little sticky and more soft so I cook it for
  an additional 5-6 minutes until I get that texture.
- Remove from heat, top off cheese, a dollop of sour cream and enjoy!!
