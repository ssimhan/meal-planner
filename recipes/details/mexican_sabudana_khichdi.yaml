instructions: "Quick Soak Sabudana\nHeat 2-3 cups of water until it is boiling hot.\
  \ It\u2019s convenient to do this in a hot water kettle or right on the stove.\n\
  Rinse the sabudana thoroughly (wash about 2-3 times until you get clear liquid).\
  \ Drain the liquid and place in a deep bowl.\nPour 1.5 cups of the hot water on\
  \ top of the sabudana and let it sit for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, press a\
  \ few of the sabudana between your fingers- they should be soft.\nDrain the sabudana\
  \ , rinse with cold water and transfer the sabudana to a wide colander or spread\
  \ out in a large pan until the sabudana is completely dry (about 15-20 minutes).\n\
  Directions\nIn a large pot, heat the oil over medium high heat. Once the oil is\
  \ hot, add the cumin seeds and scallion whites and stir.\nNext add the bell peppers,\
  \ turmeric, chili powder, taco seasoning and cook on low heat until the bell peppers\
  \ are soft.\nOnce the peppers are soft, add the garlic and salt.\nAdd the sabudana,\
  \ cilantro, lime juice, green scallions and mix until everything is well combined.I\
  \ like my sabudana a little sticky and more soft so I cook it for an additional\
  \ 5-6 minutes until I get that texture.\nRemove from heat, top off cheese, a dollop\
  \ of sour cream and enjoy!!"
