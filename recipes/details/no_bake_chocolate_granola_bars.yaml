instructions: 'Line an 8×8-inch pan with parchment paper, leaving enough on the sides
  for you to lift the bars out of the pan.

  Add the chocolate chips, peanut butter, and brown rice syrup to a large heat-proof
  bowl. Heat in the microwave in 30 second intervals until smooth, stopping to stir.
  (It should take a minute).

  Add the cereal, oats, cereal, and dried cherries.

  Stir with a wooden spoon, then use your (clean) hands to massage the ingredients
  together until well incorporated.

  Pour into pan and use your hands to press down firmly and evenly.

  Chill for 10-20 minutes, use the parchment to remove from the pan, and slice into
  bars. Serve chilled (they will be firmer) or at room temperature.'
