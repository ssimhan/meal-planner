instructions: '**For the Black Bean Tacos:**Preheat oven to 450F. Line a baking sheet
  pan with parchment paper.

  In a skillet over medium high heat, add the olive oil to heat up for 1 minute.

  Add the minced garlic, onion, and jalapeño peppers. Sauce for 1 minute, until fragrant.

  Add the drained black beans and tomato paste. Stir to combine.

  Add 1 cup water, stir to combine, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer.

  Using a fork, lightly smash the black beans. Add more water as necessary to keep
  the black beans moist but not liquid-y.

  Add the taco seasoning, lime juice, and salt and black pepper to taste.

  Evenly distribute and spread over the tortillas. Place on the prepared baking pan.

  Brush each tortilla with olive oil.

  Bake for 8-10 minutes, until lightly golden brown, flip the tortillas over and bake
  another 8-10 minutes. Enjoy warm!

  **For the Cilantro Yogurt Sauce:**Blend all ingredients together in a food processor
  or high speed blender until smooth and creamy. Serve immediately or store in an
  airtight container in the fridge up to 4 days.'
