instructions: 'Fry toor dal with red chillies, with little oil till golden brown in
  medium flame or low flame.

  Cool down and grind it to a coarse paste with added salt, peeled garlic and required.

  You can add 2 tablespoon of coconut while grinding, that will give you an enhanced
  taste!

  A pinch of tamarind is also a good idea.

  To eat with rice, mix this paste with rice and little sesame oil or you can have
  as an accompaniment for vatral kuzhambu rice or curd rice!'
