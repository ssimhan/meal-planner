instructions: 'To begin making the Green Beans Paruppu Usili Recipe, soak the toor
  dal in water for about 1 hour.

  Once the dal is soaked until soft; drain the excess water.

  Into a food processor/mixer, add in the toor dal, turmeric powder and dried red
  chillies and blend to make a coarse mixture. You want the Paruppu Usili to have
  a coarse texture when steamed.

  Grease the steamer plates or idli plates with a oil and spoon the ground paruppu
  usili mixture into the steamer plates.

  Place the filled steamer plates into the steamer and steam for 10 minutes on high
  heat. Once steamed, turn off the heat and keep aside and allow it to cool.

  Once the cooled, transfer to a large mixing bowl and crumble the steamed paruppu
  - this mixture is called the paruppu usili (crumbled dal). Keep this aside.

  The next step is to cook the green beans.

  In a pressure cooker, add the chopped green beans along with 2 tablespoons of water.
  Sprinkle in a little salt.

  Pressure cook the green beans for 2 whistles on high heat, turn off the heat and
  run the pressure cooker under water to release pressure immediately. The beans will
  be cooked perfectly without loss of colour and nutrition.

  Place a wok or kadai on medium heat and add a teaspoon of oil. Once the oil is hot,
  add mustard seeds and urad dal and allow it to crackle and the dal to turn golden
  brown.

  After the seeds have crackled, add asafoetida, the curry leaves and the steamed
  paruppu usili and mix thoroughly.

  Saute the dal in the oil for a good 3 to 4 minutes until it gets a perfect crumbly
  texture. Once you have a good texture, stir in the green beans and turn off the
  heat. Check the salt and adjust to taste accordingly.

  Serve with Vathal Kuzhambu Recipe and Rice for a weekday meal.'
