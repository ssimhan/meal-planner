appliances:

ingredients:
- 2 onions
- Ginger paste
- Green chilies
- Green chilies (chopped)
- Ghee
- Cumin seeds
- Salt
- 1cupwhole moong beans
prep_steps:
- Pour fresh water and soak in enough water for about 4 to 6 hours. If using rice
  soak it along with dal. I don’t use rice most of the times.
- Once the green gram is soaked, rinse them well.
cook_steps:
- Rinse well a few times until the water runs clear.
- Blend with ginger, salt, green chilies, cumin seeds.
- Chop onions. Sauté with ghee, cumin, green chilies until slightly brown
- When making the peasrattu, sprinkle fried onions on topping
- To make the next one, ensure the pan is not very hot. If it is too hot, reduce the
  flame or turn off the stove for a while and then make the next one.
- If you are unable to spread the batter on the tawa it means the batter is very thick.
  Add back to the blender with little water and blend again. Adding water directly
  to the batter most times doesn’t yield me good ones.
