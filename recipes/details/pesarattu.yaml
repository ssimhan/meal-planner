instructions: "Rinse well a few times until the water runs clear.\nPour fresh water\
  \ and soak in enough water for about 4 to 6 hours. If using rice soak it along with\
  \ dal. I don\u2019t use rice most of the times.\nOnce the green gram is soaked,\
  \ rinse them well.\nBlend with ginger, salt, green chilies, cumin seeds.\nChop onions.\
  \ Saut\xE9 with ghee, cumin, green chilies until slightly brown\nWhen making the\
  \ peasrattu, sprinkle fried onions on topping\nTo make the next one, ensure the\
  \ pan is not very hot. If it is too hot, reduce the flame or turn off the stove\
  \ for a while and then make the next one.\nIf you are unable to spread the batter\
  \ on the tawa it means the batter is very thick. Add back to the blender with little\
  \ water and blend again. Adding water directly to the batter most times doesn\u2019\
  t yield me good ones."
