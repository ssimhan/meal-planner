instructions: 'AD

  Stir together the wet ingredients in a large bowl.

  Fold in the dry ingredients, reserving some of the pepperoni.

  Portion out into a greased muffin tin and top with pepperoni.

  Bake and serve or store.

  AD

  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and grease a standard muffin tin well with nonstick
  spray.

  Add the milk, carrot, cheeses, butter, pepperoni (reserving the 2 tablespoons),
  and egg to a medium bowl. Stir together.

  Stir in the flours, baking powder, baking soda, pizza seasoning, and salt.

  Divide batter among the prepared muffin tin, using a heaping ¼ cup in each. Top
  each with pepperoni.

  Bake for 18-20 minutes or until lightly golden brown around the edges and a cake
  tester inserted into the center comes out clean. (There may be some melted cheese
  on it, though!)

  Let cool in the pan for 2-5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
  You may need to use a paring knife around the edges of the muffins to help remove
  them from the pan.

  Serve slightly warm.'
