instructions: 'Mix ingredients together. For the plain version this will just be milk
  and oats, for the flavoured versions it will include all the other ingredients.

  Allow the mixture to sit for a couple of minutes, until mushy.

  Press the mixture into a small, flat-bottomed microwavable dish. Use the back of
  a spoon to do this until the mixture is flat.

  Microwave for 2 mins on high. The cooked mixture will be soft but you should be
  able to cut through it.

  Cut the fingers while still hot and serve once cooled.

  STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS

  Store in airtight container in fridge for 1-2 days and in freezer for up to one
  month.'
