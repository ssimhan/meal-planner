instructions: 'AD

  Add the wet ingredients, including the mashed banana, to a large mixing bowl.

  Stir together.

  Gently stir in the dry ingredients.

  Pour batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick or cake tester inserted
  into the center comes out clean.

  Run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen, then cool on a wire rack before
  slicing.

  AD

  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Coat a mini loaf pan or standard 9×5-inch loaf
  pan with nonstick spray.

  In a large bowl, stir together the yogurt, banana, maple syrup, peanut butter, eggs,
  and vanilla.

  Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.

  Gently stir the yogurt mixture into the flour mixture.

  Pour batter into the prepared pan.

  Bake for 26-28 minutes if using a mini loaf pan or until the edges are lightly golden
  brown and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool for 5
  minutes in the pan, then remove from pan and cool completely on a wire rack before
  slicing.

  To make in a standard 9×5-inch baking loaf pan, reduce the oven temperature to 350
  degrees F and bake for 55-60 minutes. Towards the end of baking, if the bread is
  browning a lot on top, cover with foil and continue baking.'
