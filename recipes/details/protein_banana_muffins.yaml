instructions: 'Prep:

  Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

  Grease a standard 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray or line with paper liners.

  Cook:

  In a large bowl, combine the Greek yogurt, mashed bananas, peanut butter, maple
  syrup, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth.

  Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt to the wet ingredients.
  If using protein powder or other optional add-ins like chocolate chips or blueberries,
  fold them in now. Stir gently until just combined; avoid overmixing.

  Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups, filling each about three-quarters
  full.

  Bake for 14-16 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden and a toothpick inserted
  into the center of a muffin comes out clean.

  Allow the muffins to cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring them
  to a wire rack to cool completely.

  Enjoy your muffins!'
