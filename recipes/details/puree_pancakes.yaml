instructions: 'Combine all dry ingredients and mix together well with fork or whisk.

  Add beaten egg, oil, vanilla if using, baby food, and mix.

  Add enough milk to give the batter the consistency you like; about a half cup should
  be right. The thicker the batter, the thicker your pancakes, the thinner, obviously,
  the thinner the pancakes will be.

  Heat a griddle or skillet to medium heat. When tiny droplets of water sizzle and
  evaporate the griddle is hot enough. You can either lightly oil the griddle or use
  non stick cooking spray.

  Drop a little less than 1/4 cup of batter on the griddle at a time.

  Note: using baby food makes the batter a little more dense than regular pancakes,
  so they will need a little longer to cook to avoid being soggy in the middle, so
  either reduce the heat and cook them longer or make smaller pancakes. Enjoy!'
