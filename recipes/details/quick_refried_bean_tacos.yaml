instructions: 'Make the filling: Mince the garlic. In a medium skillet, heat the olive
  oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant
  but not yet browned (or skip this step and use garlic powder instead). Heat the
  refried beans, cumin and kosher salt until warmed, about 3 minutes. Taste and adjust
  flavors as desired.

  Prep the veggies: Chop the lettuce. Dice the bell pepper. Prep the other toppings
  as desired. (If using pickled red onions, it’s easiest to make them in advance.)

  Warm the tortillas: Warm and char the tortillas by placing them on an open gas flame
  on medium for a few seconds per side, flipping with tongs, until they are slightly
  blackened and warm. (See How to Warm Tortillas.)

  Serve: Place the refried beans in the tortillas, then top with toppings and enjoy.'
