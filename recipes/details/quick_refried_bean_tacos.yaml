  medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant but not
  yet browned (or skip this step and use garlic powder instead). Heat the refried
  beans, cumin and kosher salt until warmed, about 3 minutes. Taste and adjust flavors
  as desired.'

  as desired. (If using pickled red onions, it’s easiest to make them in advance.)'

  flame on medium for a few seconds per side, flipping with tongs, until they are
  slightly blackened and warm. (See How to Warm Tortillas.)'
