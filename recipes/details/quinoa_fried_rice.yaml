prep_steps: []
cook_steps:
- Cook the quinoa (or use Instant Pot quinoa OR if you have cooked quinoa, skip to
  Step 2).
- Cool the quinoa by spreading it into a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze
  for 5 to 10 minutes. If making in advance, refrigerate the quinoa until serving.
- Slice the green onions; reserve the dark green portions for a garnish.
- Dice the onion and carrots.
- In a very large skillet, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and white
  and light green portions of the green onions and sauté until translucent, about
  3 minutes, then add the carrots and sauté for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger
  and sauté for 2 minutes.
- Add the quinoa and salt and stir to combine.
- Make a well in the quinoa, exposing the pan, and crack the eggs into the pan.
- Scramble the eggs and cook for several minutes until they are soft, then stir them
  into the quinoa (resist the urge to stir them into the quinoa until they are cooked).
  Add the baby greens and continue to stir until they are fully wilted, about 1 to
  2 minutes. Turn off the heat, stir in the soy sauce and green onion tops and mix.
  Taste and add additional salt as desired (we added an additional ¼ teaspoon as our
  soy sauce was low sodium).
- 'If desired, drizzle with sriracha and/or additional soy sauce. Serving suggestion:
  serve with Easy Edamame for a filling meal.'
