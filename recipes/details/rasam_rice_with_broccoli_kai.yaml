instructions: 'Chop 1 medium tomato.

  Crush 2 garlic cloves.

  Cut 1/2 head of broccoli into small florets.

  Cook 1 cup rice and keep it ready (preferably slightly mushy, like for rasam rice).

  In a pot, mix 1 tsp tamarind concentrate with 3 cups water.

  Add chopped tomato, crushed garlic, 1/4 tsp turmeric powder, 1 tsp black pepper,
  1 tsp cumin seeds, 1/2 tsp rasam powder, and salt.

  Let it simmer on medium heat for 10–12 minutes until tomatoes soften and flavors
  blend. Don''t boil too hard—rasam should be light.

  In a small pan, heat 1 tsp ghee or oil.

  Add 1 tsp mustard seeds. When they splutter, add 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 1 red chilli,
  pinch of hing, and curry leaves.

  Pour this tempering into the simmering rasam. Turn off heat.

  Heat 1 tsp oil in a pan.

  Add broccoli florets and sauté on medium heat for 4–5 minutes.

  Sprinkle 1/4 tsp turmeric powder, 1/2 tsp red chilli powder, and salt.

  Stir and cook until broccoli is tender but not mushy (about 3–4 more minutes).

  In a bowl or plate, mix cooked rice with hot rasam.

  Top or serve it with the sautéed broccoli kai on the side or mixed in.'
