instructions: 'Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil, seasoned with about 1 tablespoon
  kosher salt.

  Make the gnocchi sauce: Peel the garlic. In a blender or food processor, process
  all ingredients until smooth. Taste and add additional seasonings if desired.

  Once the water is boiling, add the gnocchi and boil until they float, about 2 to
  3 minutes.

  Meanwhile, line a colander with spinach leaves. When the gnocchi are done, pour
  them into the colander with the spinach so that the boiling water wilts the spinach.
  Then pour the cooked gnocchi and spinach back into the pot and stir to a few times
  to evenly distribute the spinach.

  Add 1 cup of the romesco sauce to the pot and stir. (Reserve and refrigerate the
  remaining 1 ½ cups for up to 1 week.)

  For vegan, top with fresh ground black pepper. For vegetarian, top with black pepper
  and feta crumbles. If desired, add a drizzle of olive oil.'
