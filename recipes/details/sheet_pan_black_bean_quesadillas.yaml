instructions: 'Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment
  paper.

  Place the tortillas on a baking sheet. They can overlap a little. Spread 1 tablespoon
  of pumpkin puree on half of each tortilla. (You''ll leave one half empty so you
  can fold it over to make a half-moon shape.)

  Top puree with ¼ cup beans, ¼ cheese, and a sprinkle of cumin.

  Bake for 5- 7 minutes or until heated through and melty. Fold the empty side of
  the tortilla over and press down. Flip over and bake for an additional 2-3 minutes
  and remove from the oven.

  Cut with kitchen shears and serve with desired dippings.'
