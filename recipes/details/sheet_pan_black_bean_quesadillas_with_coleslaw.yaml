instructions: 'Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment
  paper.

  Place the tortillas on a baking sheet. They can overlap a little. Spread 1 mashed
  avocado on half of each tortilla. (You''ll leave one half empty so you can fold
  it over to make a half-moon shape.)

  Top puree with ¼ cup beans, ¼ cheese, and a sprinkle of cumin.

  Bake for 5- 7 minutes or until heated through and melty. Fold the empty side of
  the tortilla over and press down. Flip over and bake for an additional 2-3 minutes
  and remove from the oven.

  While in the oven, take the coleslaw mix, rinse with water and drain well.

  Add some mayo, lime juice, salt, red chili powder and garlic powder.

  Serve quesadillas with side of coleslaw.

  Alternative to coleslaw:Cucumber, tomatoes, oil, vinegar or lime juice, salt and
  pepper to taste with some cilantro'
