instructions: 'Here’s a peak at how to make this recipe so you know what to expect
  from the process. Scroll down to the bottom of the post for the full information
  including the timing and amounts.

  Rinse and drain the chickpeas.

  Add to the food processor with the rest of the ingredients except the flour and
  chocolate chips. Grind well. Pulse in the flour and chocolate.

  Spread into a pan.

  Bake until golden around the edges and just firm.

  No, but I will say that they are best when you make sure to grind up the batter
  as smooth as possible for the best final texture.

  You can use sunflower seed butter instead of the peanut butter if you prefer.

  Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. I prefer
  them chilled, but they are fine at any temperature.

  Be sure to use a very ripe banana for the best flavor.

  These are not super sweet, so add up to ¼ cup sugar to the batter if desired.

  Use honey instead of maple syrup if needed.

  Use almond butter or sunflower seed butter instead of the peanut butter.

  Use a gluten-free cup for cup flour blend instead of all purpose if desired.

  Make them nut-free with sunflower seed butter.

  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease an 8×8-inch pan with nonstick spray.

  Add the chickpeas to a colander to drain. Rinse with water. Drain.

  Add to a food processor with the banana, peanut butter, maple syrup, vanilla, salt,
  and baking soda. Grind on high to make a uniformly smooth batter. (It might take
  15-30 seconds.)

  Pulse in the flour and chocolate until just combined.

  Pour batter into the prepared pan and bake for 24-26 minutes, or until the edges
  are lightly golden brown and the top is firm to the touch.

  Let cool fully in the pan and slice to serve.'
