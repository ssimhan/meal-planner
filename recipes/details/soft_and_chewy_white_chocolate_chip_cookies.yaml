cook_steps:
- Now, if you like your cookie a little crunchier, you can bake these cookies a tad
  longer in the oven. A crunchy cookie is great to dunk in milk or in a warm cup of
  hot chocolate.
- Would you rather have Macadamia Nuts in them? You could always add them to this
  recipe or you could try this cookie recipe here.
- Cream all of the ingredients together.
- 'To make this cookie recipe: simply mix sugars, softened butter and egg together
  in medium bowl. (Remember, my favorite bowl is no more. I still mourn the loss.)'
- Then mix in the dry ingredients. Stir well and put on cookie sheet (ungreased).
- Then bake and serve. Delicious and easy!
- Yes, you do. Too little or too much of the brown sugar will drastically result in
  cookies that don't turn out right. Be sure to measure the brown sugar carefully.
- I would cook them for 12-15 minutes and go from there.
- Wait! 365 degrees? Why?
- Good question! I found that one of the secrets to these cookies is 365 degrees is
  the perfect. 375 degrees is too high and 350 degrees is too low.
- I personally think this cookie recipe is the best for soft and chewy cookies and
  I urge you to try it.
- You will probably never use another cookie recipe again.
- Cream together butter, sugars and egg in a large bowl
- Stir in flour, baking soda and salt
- Fold in white chocolate chips
- Roll into 1 inch balls and place on ungreased cookie sheet
- Bake at 365* for 8 minutes or until done
- Preheat oven to 365°
