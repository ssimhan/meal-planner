instructions: 'Meal Prep InstructionsLabel your gallon-sized freezer bag. Make sure
  to include name, instructions, and a use-by date (I recommend 90 days after prep
  date).Add all of the ingredients (except for the coconut milk, and broth) to a freezer
  bag. Stir gently to combine.Remove air, seal, and freeze.

  Instant Pot InstructionsThaw the freezer meal overnight in the fridge.From thawed,
  add the coconut milk, and broth, stir to combine and then pressure cook on high
  for 10 minutes, then natural release for 10 minutes. Add salt as desired.

  Use an immersion blender inside of the Instant Pot, or transfer 1/2 of the soup
  to a blender and blend until smooth. Return to Instant Pot.

  Tip: Garnish with sliced jalapeno, freshly chopped tomatoes, and your favorite hot
  sauce.'
