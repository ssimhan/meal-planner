cook_steps:
- Toast the tortillas on each side in a dry skillet over medium-low heat until they
  are a slightly stiff and have browned just a bit on the edges. Stack them on a plate
  until ready to use. Toasting the tortillas increases the flavor and helps prevent
  them from cracking. Shred an 8oz. block of pepper jack cheese. Half will be used
  for the enchilada filling and half will be used for the sauce.
- Defrost the frozen spinach in a microwave or take it out of the freezer before beginning
  to allow it time to defrost naturally. Squeeze as much moisture out of the thawed
  spinach as possible. Place the spinach in a large bowl. Rinse and drain the white
  beans, then add them to the bowl with the spinach. Also add 4oz. of the shredded
  cheese, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and a little freshly cracked pepper. Stir until
  the mixture is evenly combined.
- Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Begin preparing the pepper jack sauce by adding the butter
  and minced garlic to a small sauce pot. Sauté the garlic in the butter for one minute
  over medium heat. Add the milk and cream cheese to the pot. Stir and heat until
  the cream cheese has fully melted into the milk and the mixture has thickened slightly.
  Season with salt. Begin adding the remaining shredded pepper jack, a handful at
  a time, and stirring it in until fully melted before adding more. Once all the cheese
  has been melted into the sauce, turn the heat off and allow it to cool slightly.
- Coat the inside of a casserole dish with non-stick spray. Begin filling the toasted
  tortillas with the spinach and white bean mixture and rolling them closed. Line
  up the filled tortillas in the casserole dish, seam sides facing down. Choose a
  casserole dish that fits 12 of the rolled enchiladas snugly to help keep them from
  unrolling.
- Once the tortillas are filled and in the casserole dish, pour the pepper jack sauce
  over top. Bake the enchiladas in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until
  the edges of the tortillas are brown and the pepper jack sauce is thick and browned
  on the edges. Sprinkle chopped cilantro over top, if desired.
