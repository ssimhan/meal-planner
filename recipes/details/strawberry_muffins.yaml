instructions: 'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)

  Lightly beat milk, oil, and egg in a small bowl.

  Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.

  Toss in chopped strawberries and stir to coat with flour.

  Fold in the milk mixture until just combined.  Can add in some vanilla extract too
  if desired.

  Divide batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups.

  Bake in the preheated oven until the tops bounce back from the touch and a toothpick
  inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven
  and cool for 10 minutes in the pan before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.'
