instructions: 'Set corn to cook in microwave.

  Dice peppers and onion.

  Set up rotimatic if using. Adults need 3-4, kids need 2-3.

  Heat a large wide skillet over medium high heat. Add oil. Once oil is hot add the
  cumin seeds and let splutter for about 10-15 seconds.

  Add the sliced peppers and onions and sauté until slightly softened (about 4-5 minutes)

  Drain the cooked corn and let it cool.

  Add garlic, dry seasonings, and salt to the pan - reduce heat to low so the spices
  do not burn.

  Add corn, cilantro and stir well. Taste test for spice and salt levels. Remove from
  heat.

  Mix cream cheese and Sriracha sauce.

  In a large pan heat up a little bit of oil and add one tortilla spread with a layer
  of the cream cheese mixture.

  the tortilla over.
