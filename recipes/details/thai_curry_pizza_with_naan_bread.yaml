instructions: 'Preheat oven to 450°F. Place naan directly on the oven grate and pre-bake
  3 to 4 minutes per side until crisp.

  Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine Muir Glen crushed fire-roasted tomatoes with
  red curry paste, Sriracha, and a few pinches of kosher salt.

  Thinly slice the red pepper. Thinly slice the green onions.

  When the naan is ready, spread each with the tomato mixture, then top with mozzarella
  cheese, vegetables, cashews, and a sprinkle of kosher salt. Bake for 5 minutes,
  until the cheese is melted.

  Meanwhile, chop the cilantro. Remove the pizza from the oven and garnish with a
  few cilantro leaves. Slice and serve immediately.'
