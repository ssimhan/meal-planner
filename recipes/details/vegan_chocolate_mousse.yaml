- Spoon the top solid part of the coconut milk into a medium bowl. (Use the remaining
  liquid part for a future smoothie.) For the result to be super creamy, we want only
  the firm solids of the coconut milk.
- Add the rest of the ingredients and stir well to combine thoroughly. Sweeten to
  taste as you like.
- Serve the mixture soft with its pudding-like texture or refrigerate briefly to firm
  up into a more solid mousse.
