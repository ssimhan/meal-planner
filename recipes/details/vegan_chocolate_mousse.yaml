instructions: 'AD

  Spoon the top solid part of the coconut milk into a medium bowl. (Use the remaining
  liquid part for a future smoothie.) For the result to be super creamy, we want only
  the firm solids of the coconut milk.

  Add the rest of the ingredients and stir well to combine thoroughly. Sweeten to
  taste as you like.

  Serve the mixture soft with its pudding-like texture or refrigerate briefly to firm
  up into a more solid mousse.
