ingredients:
- Pasta (optional)
- Quinoa (optional side)
- Tablespoons olive oil
- Garlic cloves
- Salt and pepper
- Teaspoons lemon pepper seasoning
- 1/4CupCornstarch
- Steamed Broccoli (optional)
- 1 block extra firm tofu, frozen
prep_steps:
- When ready to cook, thaw the tofu completely, then take it out of the package and
  drain it.
cook_steps:
- 'Night before: freeze the block of tofu until completely frozen. This changes the
  texture.'
- Press the tofu for 10-15 minutes to get any excess liquid out while you preheat
  the oven to 400 degrees F.
- Break the block of tofu into small pieces. The texture will be firm and meaty now
  so it will break apart into pieces easily.
- Put the tofu into a large mixing bowl. Then sprinkle with cornstarch onto the tofu
  and toss to coat.
- Now drizzle with the olive oil and toss so all of the tofu is wet with oil.
- Then sprinkle with the lemon pepper and toss to coat. If your lemon pepper seasoning
  already has salt then you can skip it. If it doesn't have salt, add a few pinches
  to the bowl with the tofu.
- Next, add the garlic to the bowl and toss one more time.
- Place the tofu on a sheet pan, lined with parchment paper or sprayed with non-stick
  spray.
- Bake for 10 minutes, flip the tofu and bake for another 10-15 minutes or until brown
  and crunchy.
- 'Serve with any sides you want: steam broccoli, pasta, quinoa, etc.'
