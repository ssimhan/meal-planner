- Add the sugar to a light-colored saucepan or skillet. Heat over medium heat for
  2-3 minutes, or until sugar has melted. Do not stir. Keep heating until the sugar
  gets a golden brown color and turns into caramel.
- As soon as the sugar has caramelized, deglaze with the 2 tablespoons of water. Be
  careful as it will spit. Next, add the vegan fish sauce, sweet chili sauce, soy
  sauce, tamarind juice, and toasted rice powder if using. Let simmer for 1 minute,
  or until the caramel has melted. Transfer the sauce to a small bowl and set aside.

- In the meantime, heat the oil in a skillet or wok over medium heat. Once hot, add
  the minced garlic and shallot, and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until fragrant.
- Add the scrambled tofu and cook for another minute. At this point you can add a
  pinch of turmeric to give the tofu a yellow color, and a pinch of kala namak salt
