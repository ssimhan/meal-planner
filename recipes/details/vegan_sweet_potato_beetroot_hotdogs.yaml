instructions: 'PrepSteam and mash beets and sweet potatoes separately. No lumps!Dice
  tomatoes and onion. Keep aside some sliced onion.Boil 1 cup of carrots & peas

  CookSauté onions for 8 minutes then add ginger garlic paste.

  Add the spices (salt, pepper, red chili flakes, coriander powder, cumin powder,
  garam masala, kitchen king) and cook for 1 minutes

  Add in the carrots & peas and chopped tomatoes and cook for about 3 minutes.

  Add the mashed beetroot and cook it well for about 4-6 mins till it releases water.

  Add 2 tbsp of flour and mix it. Cook well for about 3-4 minutes so that the flour
  cooks. You do not want raw flour taste.

  Add the mashed sweet potato to the mixture and stir it in well.

  Keep cooking on medium flame till the water in the mixture cooks off. The mixture
  should start holding its shape and doesn’t break apart. This can take 6-10 mins.

  Let the mixture cool and then shape it to a hot dog shape with wet hands or gloves
  so it doesn’t stick to you.

  Roll the shaped hot dogs in the panko/breadcrumbs.

  Mix sliced onion with dry garlic powder, lemon sauce, and Chaat masala.'
