instructions: "To Drain the Tofu\nWrap 1 package extra firm tofu with a paper towel\
  \ and place it on a tray/plate. Put another tray/plate on top of the tofu and press\
  \ it down with a heavy object for roughly 30 minutes to 1 hour. (I pressed for 2\
  \ hours this time; my single tofu block weighed 400 g before pressing and 355 g\
  \ after.) If you\u2018re in a hurry, you can microwave the tofu without plastic\
  \ wrap for 1\xBD minutes (at 1000 watts) and drain the water.\nTo Mix the Seasonings\n\
  While you're waiting for the tofu to drain, mix the seasonings. In a small bowl,\
  \ add 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 tsp toasted sesame oil, 1 Tbsp miso, 1 tsp Diamond Crystal\
  \ kosher salt, and \u215B tsp white pepper powder.\nWhisk it all together and set\
  \ aside.\nTo Make the Filling\nDiscard the tough core of 2\u20133 leaves cabbage\
  \ (green). Cut the leaves into julienned pieces.\nMince the julienned cabbage into\
  \ small pieces. Tip: It\u2018s usually easier to tuck smaller pieces in the gyoza\
  \ wrapper rather than chunkier pieces.\nRepeat with \u215B head red cabbage: Discard\
  \ the tough core of the red cabbage leaves and cut the leaves into julienned pieces.\
  \ Then, mince into small pieces.\nPut the minced green and red cabbage in a bowl\
  \ and add 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt. Rub the salt into the cabbage with\
  \ your hands and set aside until it releases its liquid.\nCut 2 inches carrot into\
  \ slabs, then sticks, and mince them.\nMince \xBD onion finely: Lay the onion flat\
  \ side down on the cutting board. With the knife tip pointing toward the root end,\
  \ make \u215B-inch vertical slices to within \xBD inch of the root end. Then, with\
  \ the knife edge toward the root end, make \u215B-inch horizontal slices, again\
  \ keeping the root intact. Finally, make perpendicular cuts down through the vertical\
  \ slices you made.\nCut 2 green onions/scallions into white and green parts. Save\
  \ the green part for garnish. Mince the white part into small pieces for the filling.\n\
  Cut off and discard the root end of 4 king oyster mushrooms (eringi). Cut the mushrooms\
  \ into sticks and then mince them.\nDiscard the stems of 2 shiitake mushrooms. Cut\
  \ the mushroom caps into strips, and then mince them.\nTo a large bowl, add the\
  \ onion, two kinds of mushrooms, carrots, and white part of the green onions. Then,\
  \ mince or press 1 clove garlic (I use my garlic press here) and add it to the bowl.\n\
  Peel and grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater ). Measure 1 tsp ginger (grated,\
  \ with juice) and add it to the filling ingredients.\nSqueeze and discard the liquid\
  \ from the cabbage. Add the cabbage to the bowl with the other ingredients.\nRemove\
  \ the paper towel and slice the tofu into thin slabs roughly \u215B inch (3 mm)\
  \ thickness (pencil width).\nNext, cut the tofu slabs into sticks, and then cut\
  \ the sticks into cubes.\nAdd the tofu cubes and the seasonings mixture to the bowl.\
  \ Mix it all together. Once the ingredients are well coated with the seasonings,\
  \ add 2 Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch and mix thoroughly. If the filling seems\
  \ watery, add more potato starch to absorb any extra moisture.\nTo Fold the Gyoza\n\
  Prepare a tray or plate with parchment paper and sprinkle some potato starch (cornstarch).\
  \ This will prevent the gyoza from sticking to the paper. Gather 80 gyoza wrappers\
  \ and prepare a small bowl of water.\nTake a wrapper and place it in the palm of\
  \ your non-dominant hand. Use a teaspoon to scoop a small amount of filling and\
  \ put it in the center of the wrapper. Dip one finger in the bowl of water and draw\
  \ a circle around the outer \xBC inch (6 mm) of the wrapper with your wet finger\
  \ until it\u2019s moistened all around.\nHere, I show you how to fold the gyoza\
  \ with the pleats leaning toward the center. Fold the wrapper in half over the filling\
  \ and pinch it in the center with your fingers, but don\u2019t seal it yet. Using\
  \ the thumb and index finger of your right hand, start making a pleat about every\
  \ \xBC inch (6 mm) on the top part of the wrapper from the center toward the right\
  \ side, making 3\u20134 pleats.\nAs you fold each pleat, press the folded pleat\
  \ tightly against the back part of the wrapper using your other thumb and index\
  \ finger. Make 3\u20134 pleats.\nContinue with the left side of the gyoza. Making\
  \ 3\u20134 pleats with your left hand, starting in the center and moving toward\
  \ the left side.\nPress the pleats tightly, making sure there are no air pockets.\
  \ Shape the gyoza to look pretty. Repeat folding the remaining wrappers. Tip: See\
  \ my Gyoza recipe for an alternative folding method where the pleats all lean toward\
  \ one side.\nTo Freeze Uncooked (optional)\nThis recipe may make more gyoza than\
  \ you wish to serve now. If you want to store some uncooked gyoza to cook later\
  \ (optional), now is the time to freeze them. Before the filling starts to release\
  \ moisture and make the wrappers soggy, cover the gyoza with plastic wrap and \u201C\
  flash freeze\u201D them in the freezer until solid (or at least frozen on the outside).\
  \ Make sure to lay out the gyoza in a single layer on a sheet pan or plate. Once\
  \ the gyoza are solid, pack them in an airtight bag. Because you flash froze them,\
  \ the gyoza won\u2019t stick to each other in the bag. You can store the gyoza in\
  \ the freezer for up to a month. When you\u2018re ready to use the gyoza, do not\
  \ defrost them. Place the frozen gyoza in your frying pan and steam them for an\
  \ extra 1\u20132 minutes.\nTo Cook the Gyoza\nTo cook the gyoza that you just folded,\
  \ heat a large nonstick frying pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add 1\
  \ Tbsp neutral oil. Then, place the gyoza in a single layer, flat side down and\
  \ without touching each other, in a circular pattern (or place them in two rows).\
  \ You will need to cook the gyoza in batches. As you can see from the photo, my\
  \ large frying pan can fit about 12\u201313 pieces per batch.\nCook until the bottoms\
  \ of the gyoza turn golden brown, about 3 minutes. Next, add \xBC cup water to the\
  \ pan.\nImmediately cover with a lid and steam the gyoza for about 3 minutes or\
  \ until most of the water evaporates. Tip: If you\u2018re cooking frozen gyoza,\
  \ steam them for an extra 1\u20132 minutes.\nRemove the lid to evaporate any remaining\
  \ water. Drizzle 1 tsp toasted sesame oil around the gyoza in the frying pan. Cook,\
  \ uncovered, until the bottom of the gyoza are golden brown and crisp.\nTo Serve:\n\
  Transfer the cooked gyoza to a plate. Repeat the process to cook the other batches.\
  \ Serve the Vegetable Gyoza with a small bowl of dipping sauce for each person.\
  \ To make the dipping sauce, combine 1 Tbsp rice vinegar (unseasoned), 1 Tbsp soy\
  \ sauce, and \u215B tsp la-yu (Japanese chili oil) in each dipping bowl and mix\
  \ it all together.\nCut the green part of a green onion for garnish, if you\u2018\
  d like.\nTo Store:\nYou can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store\
  \ in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for a month."
