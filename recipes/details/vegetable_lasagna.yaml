instructions: 'Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with
  cooking spray and set aside.

  Dice zucchini, bell pepper, onion and spinach.

  In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat. Sauté veggies
  and garlic.

  Use a separate bowl to stir together egg, parsley, basil, ricotta cheese, 1 ¼ cups
  mozzarella, and ¼ cup Parmesan.

  When the vegetables are done cooking, stir the marinara sauce into the skillet.

  Spread ¼ of the marinara-vegetable sauce mixture in a thin layer in the bottom of
  the prepared baking dish.

  Create layer of no-boil lasagna noodles, ⅓ of the ricotta mixture, and another ¼
  of the sauce mixture.

  Repeat layers two more times. Finish with remaining 1 cup of mozzarella and ¼ cup
  of Parmesan cheese on top. Cover with aluminum foil.

  Bake for 35 minutes.

  Remove foil, and bake for another 5-10 minutes (until cheese on top is browned).

  Let stand for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.'
