instructions: |
  If using fresh rice, cook it ahead and let it cool completely (or use day-old rice from fridge).
  
  Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat.
  Add beaten eggs and scramble quickly. Remove and set aside.
  
  Add remaining oil to the pan. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.
  
  Add frozen vegetables (peas, carrots, corn, edamame) and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until heated through.
  
  Add rice, breaking up any clumps. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until rice is heated through and slightly crispy.
  
  Add soy sauce and sesame oil, toss to combine.
  Return scrambled eggs to the pan and mix well.
  
  Add green onions if using, season with salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Serve hot.
