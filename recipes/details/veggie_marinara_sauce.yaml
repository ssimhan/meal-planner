  How long can I store this marinara sauce recipe?

  You can make a big batch of this on the weekend and store it in the fridge until
  you are ready to use it during the week, which is what I like to do when I’m on
  top of my meal planning. (That only happens sometimes!) It will last up to 5 days
  in an airtight container like a quart-size Mason jar.

  You can also let it cool and store it in a freezer safe container in the freezer
  for at least 3 months. Let it thaw overnight in the fridge or use the defrost feature
  on your microwave to thaw more quickly.

  Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the vegetables, stir, and
  cover. Cook for 10 minute or until mostly soft.

  Remove lid and stir in the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium low
  and place the lid so it’s mostly covering the pot but not a tight seal. This will
  let some steam escape but will protect your cooktop from splatters. Simmer for 20-25
  minutes or until everything is soft.

  Puree with an immersion blender or in a regular blender. Season to taste with additional
  salt as needed.

  Serve with 1 pound of cooked pasta and Parmesan cheese, if desired.

  Brown ½ pound ground beef or mild Italian sausage in Step 1 after you warm the oil.
  Proceed as directed.

  To do this in a Slow Cooker:

  Double all ingredient amounts and add to the slow cooker. Cook on LOW for 6-8 hours
  or until everything is softened. Finish as directed in Step 3.

  To make this into Pizza Sauce: Simmer the sauce for about 30-45 minutes longer on
  low, stirring occasionally, or until very thick. Add 1 teaspoon pizza seasoning.

  Use veggies with colors like white, yellow, orange, and red that will blend together
  into a classic looking tomato sauce when combined with the canned tomatoes.

  Double the recipe to make more and freeze the second half of the batch for a future
  week.

  Use the same volume of diced fresh tomatoes, just simmer longer to allow the extra
  liquid to evaporate.

  Serve with a pound of whichever kind of pasta your family prefers.

  Add some protein to the pasta and sauce by adding canned white beans or chickpeas,
  warmed frozen peas, diced cooked chicken breast, meatballs, or even lentils.'
