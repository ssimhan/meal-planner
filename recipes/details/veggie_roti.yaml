appliances:

ingredients:
- Wheat flour
- Ghee
- Oil
- Salt
- 1 medium potato or sweet potato
- Saran Wrap
prep_steps:
- Peel and cube the veggie into small chunks for quick steaming and steam until soft
  (I do this on stove top so I just check using a fork).
cook_steps:
- Once steamed, mash it well using a fork or masher.
- For the potato roti, heat some oil in a pan, add the mashed potatoes, salt, turmeric
  powder, kitchen king masala, Kashmiri chilli powder and garlic powder and mix it
  well for few mins.
- Transfer this mixture to a bowl, knead it gently while adding wheat flour in small
  increments, oil, and more salt if needed.
- Don’t over knead it, it is okay for the dough to be slightly sticky.Don't add any
  water.
- You can start mixing using a spoon and then go in with your hand to avoid the mess.
- For all other veggies, I don’t bring the mash back to the stove, I simply place
  the mash in a bowl, add the masalas and proceed to the kneading part.
- Take saran warp and put it on your counter.
- Oil it slightly - place a fairly big amount of dough ball , cover with another piece
  of cling wrap and roll into into a slightly thicker disc using a rolling pin.
- Since the dough will be slightly sticky this method ensures it doesn’t stick when
  rolling or transferring to the tawa.
- Transfer to the hot pan , transfer first from foil to hand and then to pan.
- Roast well on both sides and apply ghee.
