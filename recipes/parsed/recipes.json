Scroll down to the end of the post for the full recipe.\nLine an 8×8-inch baking sheet with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides (which will make it easy to lift the bars out when it's time to slice them).\nAdd the peanut butter and honey to a large heat-safe bowl. Warm in the microwave for 15-30 seconds, or until easy to stir. (This may not be necessary if you keep your peanut butter and honey at room temperature.) Stir together to combine.\nAdd the cereal and vanilla, if using, to the bowl. Stir gently, but thoroughly, using a wooden spoon or spatula. It may take a minute or two to get the mixture evenly coated.\nPress mixture into the prepared baking pan, gently pressing evenly and into the corners.\nChill for at least 20 minutes. Remove from the fridge, lift out using the parchment paper, and slice on a cutting board.\nWrap each bar in plastic wrap (optional) and store in an airtight container in the fridge. Serve cold.",

    "instructions": "Pre-heat your oven to 425F.\nPoke a few holes in your sweet potato, wrap it in a slightly damp paper towel, and microwave on high for about 6-8 minutes. The paper towel trick keeps the potato moist\nWhile you wait, combine corn, diced or minced peppers, and diced or minced onion with your black beans, garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, cilantro, cayenne, and taco sauce/salsa.\nIf you prefer very tender veggies, feel free to saute the vegetables first in a little butter or oil to tenderize.\nYour cayenne and red pepper flakes will control the spice-factor; adjust those to taste.\nI alternate between using my favorite flavorful red enchilada sauce, spicy taco sauce, and a natural, zesty salsa like Mrs. Renfros Green Salsa, all have produced delicious results!\nOnce your sweet potato is cooked, fluff the inside with a fork and add the flesh [minus the skin] to the rest of your veggies and mix thoroughly.\nAdd salt, pepper, and any additional seasoning to taste. I usually add a little extra sprinkle chili powder, cumin, and garlic!\nNext, working in small batches of maybe 3-4 tortillas, wrap corn tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave on high for 30 seconds. Follow it up with an additional 30 seconds, if needed.\nThe goal here is to steam the tortillas so they roll into perfect flautas without breaking or cracking =) This trick works like a charm!\nImmediately spray or rub one side each tortilla with oil and add \"line\" of veggie filling to the center of the \"dry side\" of each tortilla, about 1-inch thick.\nTop it off with a layer of cheese [as much or as little as you want! if you're using cream cheese as well you can mix it into the shredded cheese before topping] and roll the tortilla.\nPlace on a wire baking/cooling rack and seal with a toothpick, if needed.\nRepeat these steps until you have a rack full of flautas.\nGive them one more teeny spritz of olive oil to get them extra crispy [no-frying! whoo!] and set the rack baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.\nThe wire rack elevates the flautas and allows them to get nice and crispy on both sides. If you don't own a wire rack, simply place the flautas on aluminum foil after spraying and turn over halfway through cooking so both sides will get a chance to crisp up. Uber easy!\nBake on the middle rack, at 425F, for 15 minutes.\nAt the end, set to broil on HIGH for just under a minute to crisp the tortillas into a perfectly golden, crunchy shell.\nPile high with any + all veggies you have on hand and serve with plain greek yogurt, salsa, and guacamole for dipping! You can even whip up a small bowl of jalapeno ranch for dunking too! If you have any fresh lime or cilantro both will make a tasty garnish!",

Scroll down to the bottom of the post for the full recipe.\nAD\nAdd the ingredients to a bowl.\nMix together with a wooden spoon or your hands. Form a ball.\nRoll out between parchment paper pieces, cut out with mini cookie cutters.\nBake and enjoy.\nBest Tips for Success\nI prefer to roll the dough out between parchment paper since it’s easy, but you can also do it by coating the rolling pin with a little flour to prevent sticking.\nYou can use all-purpose flour if you prefer or if that’s what you have. I like the flavor from whole-wheat, but both will work.\nWe like to make them using mini cookie cutters, but any size will work.\nStore leftovers in an airtight container for 3-5 days at room temperature.\nYou can also store any dough you don’t use in a zip top plastic bag, tightly sealed and with as much air removed as possible, for up to a week in the fridge. Let sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before using.\nAD\nPreheat the oven to 375°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\nPlace all ingredients into a bowl and use your hand to mix together to form a dough. (If the dough is a little crumbly, be sure that it’s throughly combined and then if it’s still crumbly, add 1/2-1 tablespoon additional milk until it comes together.)\nMake a flattened disc of dough.\nRoll the dough ¼-inch thick between two pieces of lightly floured pieces of parchment paper. (The flour will ensure that the cut outs are easy to move.)\nCut out the dough with a cookie cutter and transfer to the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 7-9 minutes, until lightly browned around the edges.\nRemove from the oven, let cool on the baking sheet for a minute, and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",

Or try garlic powder or black pepper for other flavor variations.\nIf your dough is sticky at any point, place it into the fridge for a few minutes to firm up. If your dough seems to not come together when it’s in the food processor, add a few additional drops of milk.\nSet the timer for the lower end of the baking range to start, then add another minute until the edges are lightly golden brown. The edges can get very brown really fast at the end.\nTo make a smaller batch, place half of the dough into a freezer storage bag, seal, and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature, roll out, cut out shapes, and bake whenever the urge strikes!\nYou may also like my go-to Store-Bought Snacks.\nDairy-free: Use nondairy cheese and softened coconut oil in place of the cheese and butter.\nGluten-free: Use a 1:1 style of gluten-free flour blend like the one from King Arthur Flour.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.\nAdd all ingredients to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse a few times to grind, then blend for 15-20 seconds until dough comes together.\nForm the dough into a disc. Dust a piece of parchment with flour, place the dough on top, and add another piece of parchment to cover.\nRoll out until ¼ inch thick. Cut with small cookie cutters and place on the prepared baking sheet. Re-roll and cut remaining dough until completed.\n(If your milk, cheese, and butter are cold the dough should be easy to roll out between parchment paper. If the dough seems too sticky, stick it into the fridge for 5-10 minutes.)\nBake 14-16 minutes or until crackers are golden. Cool for a few minutes on a wire rack before serving.\nStore in an airtight container for up to 2 days at room temperature.",

    "instructions": "Here’s a look at the easy process involved in making this granola bar recipe. Scroll down to the bottom of this post for the full recipe.\nAdd ingredients to a food processor, choosing your flavor. Grind until the mixture starts to hold together.\nPour the batter onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and press flat.\nScore the batter with a knife, which makes them easy to break into pieces once they’re baked.\nBake, let cool, and enjoy.\nCAN I MAKE THESE WITHOUT CHIA SEEDS?\nSure! See the variation at the bottom that calls for omitting them and slightly increasing the nut butter. This keeps a good amount of healthy fats to ensure that the bars hold together and that the kids get a nicely balanced snack.\nCAN I MAKE THESE GLUTEN-FREE GRANOLA BARS?\nThese bars are naturally egg-free and dairy-free. They’re also easy to make gluten-free by choosing gluten-free oats and a gluten-free flour blend.\nHOW LONG DO THESE HEALTHY GRANOLA BARS LAST?\nI store our homemade granola bars in the fridge (because I like them cold) in an airtight container and serve them up until we run out.\nIn the fridge in an airtight container, they’ll stay fresh for about two weeks.\nAt room temperature in an airtight container, they’ll last about 1 week.\nIn the freezer, you can place cooled bars in a sealed zip top freezer bag for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before serving.\nCAN I FREEZE GRANOLA BARS?\nYes, this granola bar recipe freezes really well. Simply let them cool and place into a zip top freezer bag. Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge or at room temperature, or directly in a lunchbox.\nFlavor Variations\nI’m so happy that a reader suggested this because it works so well to use a fruit or veggie puree instead of water in the original recipe! I’ve tried making Applesauce Granola Bars, Banana Granola Bars, Butternut Squash, Sweet Potato, and Pumpkin Granola Bars.\nLook in the Notes at the bottom of the recipe for the info.\nBest Tips for Success\nFor kids under one, you can substitute brown rice syrup for the honey. You can also try using applesauce.\nYou can make them in the basic flavor, or banana, apple, sweet potato, butternut squash, or pumpkin.\nTo make these without coconut, omit and use additional oats.\nTo make these without chia seeds, omit and increase the nut butter to ¼ cup.\nTo make this without a food processor, use quick or instant oats and stir everything together. (Or grind the oats and coconut in a blender, then stir the ingredients together in a bowl)\nAdd chocolate chips to this recipe by pressing a few into the top of the rolled out batter just before baking.\nUse room temperature honey and nut or seed butter to make the batter come together easily, or warm them briefly.\nWet your fingers or use a piece of parchment to press the batter down if it’s sticking to your hands.\nYou may also like No-Bake Granola Bars, Breakfast Bars, my Easy Oatmeal Bars, and my 3-Ingredient Cereal Bars.\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat. Warm the honey and peanut butter for about 15 seconds if not stored at room temperature.\nPlace the oats and coconut into the bowl of a food processor and blitz to grind into a coarse texture (similar to quick oats).\nAdd the remaining ingredients, including the peanut butter and honey, and blend well.\n(You can also grind the oats or use instant oats, then mix everything together in a bowl.)\nAdd ¼ cup water and blend until batter comes together like thick cookie dough. You should be able to press the batter together between your fingers and have it stick together. If it doesn't, add a bit more water.\nPlace batter onto the center of the prepared baking sheet and use your hands to press thin, about ¼-½-inch thick and about 8x8-inches big. I measure roughly using an 8x8-inch baking pan. (You can also roll out the dough—just cover it with a piece of parchment paper first to make sure it's easy to do.) Use a knife to lightly score lines for squares in whatever size you like.\nBake for 18-20 minutes, remove from oven, and let cool completely on the pan.\nBreak into squares and serve.\nStore in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks in the fridge or a week at room temperature. To freeze, place cooled bars in a sealed zip top freezer bag for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before serving.",

If the dough is too tough to stretch, let it rest for 5 minutes and try again.\nChop the spinach if it's not pre-chopped.\nCook:Spread the Toppings: Spread pizza sauce over the dough. Sprinkle on the spinach, mozzarella, and Parmesan evenly.\nRoll the Dough: Starting on one long side, roll the dough up into a log, using the parchment paper to help you roll.\nSlice: Cut the rolled dough into 12 even slices using a serrated knife. To make it easier, start cutting in the center, then work on cutting each half evenly.\nBake: Place each slice into the greased muffin tin. Bake for 22-26 minutes, or until the dough is baked through, the cheese is melted, and the tops are golden brown.\nCool: Let the rolls cool in the muffin tin for 3-5 minutes to let the cheese firm up. Use a knife to loosen any stuck cheese before transferring them to a wire rack or serving plate.\nStorage:Fridge: Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.Freezer: Freeze in a zip-lock bag for up to 3 months. To reheat, microwave frozen rolls for 30-60 seconds or until warm.",

Stir to combine well and let the batter sit for 15 minutes.\nWhile the batter is resting, boil 2 cups water in the pressure cooker on sauté mode. Also, grease the steel pan in which you will make the khaman with oil. I used one container from the stackable steel containers for the instant pot.\nAfter 15 minutes, add Eno to the batter and stir it gently in one direction. The batter will become frothy and increase in volume. Do not over stir.\nQuickly transfer the batter to the greased steel container and place the container on a trivet. It is important to start cooking quickly after adding Eno to get soft and fluffy Khaman.\nSteaming in Instant Pot\nThen place the trivet along with the pan in the instant pot. Set to Steam mode for 15 mins in venting mode. The instant pot timer does not work in venting mode, hence you will need to set an external timer.\nAfter the cooking time is done, let the khaman sit for 5 minutes. Then open the lid of the instant pot and take out the khaman using tongs.\nLet it cool for 5 more minutes, so it is easy to remove. Insert a knife or toothpick to check it is cooked. The knife should come out almost clean. If not, you will need to steam for 2-3 more minutes.\nRun a knife around the edges of the khaman. Place a plate on top of the container and turn it upside down. This will help to get the khaman out of the container easily.\nPrepare Tempering\nWhile the khaman is steaming in the instant pot, heart oil in a pan on stovetop on high heat.\nThen add the mustard seeds and let them sizzle. Now add the curry leaves. Let them sauté for about 30 seconds. Add the sesame seeds and turn off heat.\nNow add water, sugar, salt and stir well.\nCut the khaman into small pieces. Spread the tempering over it.\nGarnish with chopped cilantro and serve with green mint chutney.",

It’s convenient to do this in a hot water kettle or right on the stove.\nRinse the sabudana thoroughly (wash about 2-3 times until you get clear liquid). Drain the liquid and place in a deep bowl.\nPour 1.5 cups of the hot water on top of the sabudana and let it sit for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, press a few of the sabudana between your fingers- they should be soft.\nDrain the sabudana , rinse with cold water and transfer the sabudana to a wide colander or spread out in a large pan until the sabudana is completely dry (about 15-20 minutes).\nDirections\nIn a large pot, heat the oil over medium high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and scallion whites and stir.\nNext add the bell peppers, turmeric, chili powder, taco seasoning and cook on low heat until the bell peppers are soft.\nOnce the peppers are soft, add the garlic and salt.\nAdd the sabudana, cilantro, lime juice, green scallions and mix until everything is well combined.I like my sabudana a little sticky and more soft so I cook it for an additional 5-6 minutes until I get that texture.\nRemove from heat, top off cheese, a dollop of sour cream and enjoy!!",

You want the Paruppu Usili to have a coarse texture when steamed.\nGrease the steamer plates or idli plates with a oil and spoon the ground paruppu usili mixture into the steamer plates.\nPlace the filled steamer plates into the steamer and steam for 10 minutes on high heat. Once steamed, turn off the heat and keep aside and allow it to cool.\nOnce the cooled, transfer to a large mixing bowl and crumble the steamed paruppu - this mixture is called the paruppu usili (crumbled dal). Keep this aside.\nThe next step is to cook the green beans.\nIn a pressure cooker, add the chopped green beans along with 2 tablespoons of water. Sprinkle in a little salt.\nPressure cook the green beans for 2 whistles on high heat, turn off the heat and run the pressure cooker under water to release pressure immediately. The beans will be cooked perfectly without loss of colour and nutrition.\nPlace a wok or kadai on medium heat and add a teaspoon of oil. Once the oil is hot, add mustard seeds and urad dal and allow it to crackle and the dal to turn golden brown.\nAfter the seeds have crackled, add asafoetida, the curry leaves and the steamed paruppu usili and mix thoroughly.\nSaute the dal in the oil for a good 3 to 4 minutes until it gets a perfect crumbly texture. Once you have a good texture, stir in the green beans and turn off the heat. Check the salt and adjust to taste accordingly.\nServe with Vathal Kuzhambu Recipe and Rice for a weekday meal.",

A crunchy cookie is great to dunk in milk or in a warm cup of hot chocolate.\nWould you rather have Macadamia Nuts in them? You could always add them to this recipe or you could try this cookie recipe here.\nCream all of the ingredients together.\nTo make this cookie recipe: simply mix sugars, softened butter and egg together in medium bowl. (Remember, my favorite bowl is no more. I still mourn the loss.)\nThen mix in the dry ingredients. Stir well and put on cookie sheet (ungreased).\nThen bake and serve. Delicious and easy!\nYes, you do. Too little or too much of the brown sugar will drastically result in cookies that don't turn out right. Be sure to measure the brown sugar carefully.\nI would cook them for 12-15 minutes and go from there.\nWait! 365 degrees? Why?\nGood question! I found that one of the secrets to these cookies is 365 degrees is the perfect. 375 degrees is too high and 350 degrees is too low.\nI personally think this cookie recipe is the best for soft and chewy cookies and I urge you to try it.\nYou will probably never use another cookie recipe again.\nCream together butter, sugars and egg in a large bowl\nStir in flour, baking soda and salt\nFold in white chocolate chips\nRoll into 1 inch balls and place on ungreased cookie sheet\nBake at 365* for 8 minutes or until done\nPreheat oven to 365°",

    "instructions": "Toast the tortillas on each side in a dry skillet over medium-low heat until they are a slightly stiff and have browned just a bit on the edges. Stack them on a plate until ready to use. Toasting the tortillas increases the flavor and helps prevent them from cracking. Shred an 8oz. block of pepper jack cheese. Half will be used for the enchilada filling and half will be used for the sauce.\nDefrost the frozen spinach in a microwave or take it out of the freezer before beginning to allow it time to defrost naturally. Squeeze as much moisture out of the thawed spinach as possible. Place the spinach in a large bowl. Rinse and drain the white beans, then add them to the bowl with the spinach. Also add 4oz. of the shredded cheese, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and a little freshly cracked pepper. Stir until the mixture is evenly combined.\nPreheat the oven to 350ºF. Begin preparing the pepper jack sauce by adding the butter and minced garlic to a small sauce pot. Sauté the garlic in the butter for one minute over medium heat. Add the milk and cream cheese to the pot. Stir and heat until the cream cheese has fully melted into the milk and the mixture has thickened slightly. Season with salt. Begin adding the remaining shredded pepper jack, a handful at a time, and stirring it in until fully melted before adding more. Once all the cheese has been melted into the sauce, turn the heat off and allow it to cool slightly.\nCoat the inside of a casserole dish with non-stick spray. Begin filling the toasted tortillas with the spinach and white bean mixture and rolling them closed. Line up the filled tortillas in the casserole dish, seam sides facing down. Choose a casserole dish that fits 12 of the rolled enchiladas snugly to help keep them from unrolling.\nOnce the tortillas are filled and in the casserole dish, pour the pepper jack sauce over top. Bake the enchiladas in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the edges of the tortillas are brown and the pepper jack sauce is thick and browned on the edges. Sprinkle chopped cilantro over top, if desired.",

    "instructions": "To Drain the Tofu\nWrap 1 package extra firm tofu with a paper towel and place it on a tray/plate. Put another tray/plate on top of the tofu and press it down with a heavy object for roughly 30 minutes to 1 hour. (I pressed for 2 hours this time; my single tofu block weighed 400 g before pressing and 355 g after.) If you‘re in a hurry, you can microwave the tofu without plastic wrap for 1½ minutes (at 1000 watts) and drain the water.\nTo Mix the Seasonings\nWhile you're waiting for the tofu to drain, mix the seasonings. In a small bowl, add 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 tsp toasted sesame oil, 1 Tbsp miso, 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and ⅛ tsp white pepper powder.\nWhisk it all together and set aside.\nTo Make the Filling\nDiscard the tough core of 2–3 leaves cabbage (green). Cut the leaves into julienned pieces.\nMince the julienned cabbage into small pieces. Tip: It‘s usually easier to tuck smaller pieces in the gyoza wrapper rather than chunkier pieces.\nRepeat with ⅛ head red cabbage: Discard the tough core of the red cabbage leaves and cut the leaves into julienned pieces. Then, mince into small pieces.\nPut the minced green and red cabbage in a bowl and add 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt. Rub the salt into the cabbage with your hands and set aside until it releases its liquid.\nCut 2 inches carrot into slabs, then sticks, and mince them.\nMince ½ onion finely: Lay the onion flat side down on the cutting board. With the knife tip pointing toward the root end, make ⅛-inch vertical slices to within ½ inch of the root end. Then, with the knife edge toward the root end, make ⅛-inch horizontal slices, again keeping the root intact. Finally, make perpendicular cuts down through the vertical slices you made.\nCut 2 green onions/scallions into white and green parts. Save the green part for garnish. Mince the white part into small pieces for the filling.\nCut off and discard the root end of 4 king oyster mushrooms (eringi). Cut the mushrooms into sticks and then mince them.\nDiscard the stems of 2 shiitake mushrooms. Cut the mushroom caps into strips, and then mince them.\nTo a large bowl, add the onion, two kinds of mushrooms, carrots, and white part of the green onions. Then, mince or press 1 clove garlic (I use my garlic press here) and add it to the bowl.\nPeel and grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater ). Measure 1 tsp ginger (grated, with juice) and add it to the filling ingredients.\nSqueeze and discard the liquid from the cabbage. Add the cabbage to the bowl with the other ingredients.\nRemove the paper towel and slice the tofu into thin slabs roughly ⅛ inch (3 mm) thickness (pencil width).\nNext, cut the tofu slabs into sticks, and then cut the sticks into cubes.\nAdd the tofu cubes and the seasonings mixture to the bowl. Mix it all together. Once the ingredients are well coated with the seasonings, add 2 Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch and mix thoroughly. If the filling seems watery, add more potato starch to absorb any extra moisture.\nTo Fold the Gyoza\nPrepare a tray or plate with parchment paper and sprinkle some potato starch (cornstarch). This will prevent the gyoza from sticking to the paper. Gather 80 gyoza wrappers and prepare a small bowl of water.\nTake a wrapper and place it in the palm of your non-dominant hand. Use a teaspoon to scoop a small amount of filling and put it in the center of the wrapper. Dip one finger in the bowl of water and draw a circle around the outer ¼ inch (6 mm) of the wrapper with your wet finger until it’s moistened all around.\nHere, I show you how to fold the gyoza with the pleats leaning toward the center. Fold the wrapper in half over the filling and pinch it in the center with your fingers, but don’t seal it yet. Using the thumb and index finger of your right hand, start making a pleat about every ¼ inch (6 mm) on the top part of the wrapper from the center toward the right side, making 3–4 pleats.\nAs you fold each pleat, press the folded pleat tightly against the back part of the wrapper using your other thumb and index finger. Make 3–4 pleats.\nContinue with the left side of the gyoza. Making 3–4 pleats with your left hand, starting in the center and moving toward the left side.\nPress the pleats tightly, making sure there are no air pockets. Shape the gyoza to look pretty. Repeat folding the remaining wrappers. Tip: See my Gyoza recipe for an alternative folding method where the pleats all lean toward one side.\nTo Freeze Uncooked (optional)\nThis recipe may make more gyoza than you wish to serve now. If you want to store some uncooked gyoza to cook later (optional), now is the time to freeze them. Before the filling starts to release moisture and make the wrappers soggy, cover the gyoza with plastic wrap and “flash freeze” them in the freezer until solid (or at least frozen on the outside). Make sure to lay out the gyoza in a single layer on a sheet pan or plate. Once the gyoza are solid, pack them in an airtight bag. Because you flash froze them, the gyoza won’t stick to each other in the bag. You can store the gyoza in the freezer for up to a month. When you‘re ready to use the gyoza, do not defrost them. Place the frozen gyoza in your frying pan and steam them for an extra 1–2 minutes.\nTo Cook the Gyoza\nTo cook the gyoza that you just folded, heat a large nonstick frying pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil. Then, place the gyoza in a single layer, flat side down and without touching each other, in a circular pattern (or place them in two rows). You will need to cook the gyoza in batches. As you can see from the photo, my large frying pan can fit about 12–13 pieces per batch.\nCook until the bottoms of the gyoza turn golden brown, about 3 minutes. Next, add ¼ cup water to the pan.\nImmediately cover with a lid and steam the gyoza for about 3 minutes or until most of the water evaporates. Tip: If you‘re cooking frozen gyoza, steam them for an extra 1–2 minutes.\nRemove the lid to evaporate any remaining water. Drizzle 1 tsp toasted sesame oil around the gyoza in the frying pan. Cook, uncovered, until the bottom of the gyoza are golden brown and crisp.\nTo Serve:\nTransfer the cooked gyoza to a plate. Repeat the process to cook the other batches. Serve the Vegetable Gyoza with a small bowl of dipping sauce for each person. To make the dipping sauce, combine 1 Tbsp rice vinegar (unseasoned), 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and ⅛ tsp la-yu (Japanese chili oil) in each dipping bowl and mix it all together.\nCut the green part of a green onion for garnish, if you‘d like.\nTo Store:\nYou can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for a month.",

(That only happens sometimes!) It will last up to 5 days in an airtight container like a quart-size Mason jar.\nYou can also let it cool and store it in a freezer safe container in the freezer for at least 3 months. Let it thaw overnight in the fridge or use the defrost feature on your microwave to thaw more quickly.\nHeat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the vegetables, stir, and cover. Cook for 10 minute or until mostly soft.\nRemove lid and stir in the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium low and place the lid so it’s mostly covering the pot but not a tight seal. This will let some steam escape but will protect your cooktop from splatters. Simmer for 20-25 minutes or until everything is soft.\nPuree with an immersion blender or in a regular blender. Season to taste with additional salt as needed.\nServe with 1 pound of cooked pasta and Parmesan cheese, if desired.\nBrown ½ pound ground beef or mild Italian sausage in Step 1 after you warm the oil. Proceed as directed.\nTo do this in a Slow Cooker:\nDouble all ingredient amounts and add to the slow cooker. Cook on LOW for 6-8 hours or until everything is softened. Finish as directed in Step 3.\nTo make this into Pizza Sauce: Simmer the sauce for about 30-45 minutes longer on low, stirring occasionally, or until very thick. Add 1 teaspoon pizza seasoning.\nUse veggies with colors like white, yellow, orange, and red that will blend together into a classic looking tomato sauce when combined with the canned tomatoes.\nDouble the recipe to make more and freeze the second half of the batch for a future week.\nUse the same volume of diced fresh tomatoes, just simmer longer to allow the extra liquid to evaporate.\nServe with a pound of whichever kind of pasta your family prefers.\nAdd some protein to the pasta and sauce by adding canned white beans or chickpeas, warmed frozen peas, diced cooked chicken breast, meatballs, or even lentils.",
