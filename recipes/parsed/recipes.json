Line an 8×8-inch baking sheet with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides (which will make it easy to lift the bars out when it's time to slice them).\n3. Add the peanut butter and honey to a large heat-safe bowl. Warm in the microwave for 15-30 seconds, or until easy to stir. (This may not be necessary if you keep your peanut butter and honey at room temperature.) Stir together to combine.\n4. Add the cereal and vanilla, if using, to the bowl. Stir gently, but thoroughly, using a wooden spoon or spatula. It may take a minute or two to get the mixture evenly coated.\n5. Press mixture into the prepared baking pan, gently pressing evenly and into the corners.\n6. Chill for at least 20 minutes. Remove from the fridge, lift out using the parchment paper, and slice on a cutting board.\n7. Wrap each bar in plastic wrap (optional) and store in an airtight container in the fridge. Serve cold.",

    "instructions": "1. Pre-heat your oven to 425F.\n2. Poke a few holes in your sweet potato, wrap it in a slightly damp paper towel, and microwave on high for about 6-8 minutes. The paper towel trick keeps the potato moist\n3. While you wait, combine corn, diced or minced peppers, and diced or minced onion with your black beans, garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, cilantro, cayenne, and taco sauce/salsa.\n4. If you prefer very tender veggies, feel free to saute the vegetables first in a little butter or oil to tenderize.\n5. Your cayenne and red pepper flakes will control the spice-factor; adjust those to taste.\n6. I alternate between using my favorite flavorful red enchilada sauce, spicy taco sauce, and a natural, zesty salsa like Mrs. Renfros Green Salsa, all have produced delicious results!\n7. Once your sweet potato is cooked, fluff the inside with a fork and add the flesh [minus the skin] to the rest of your veggies and mix thoroughly.\n8. Add salt, pepper, and any additional seasoning to taste. I usually add a little extra sprinkle chili powder, cumin, and garlic!\n9. Next, working in small batches of maybe 3-4 tortillas, wrap corn tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave on high for 30 seconds. Follow it up with an additional 30 seconds, if needed.\n10. The goal here is to steam the tortillas so they roll into perfect flautas without breaking or cracking =) This trick works like a charm!\n11. Immediately spray or rub one side each tortilla with oil and add \"line\" of veggie filling to the center of the \"dry side\" of each tortilla, about 1-inch thick.\n12. Top it off with a layer of cheese [as much or as little as you want! if you're using cream cheese as well you can mix it into the shredded cheese before topping] and roll the tortilla.\n13. Place on a wire baking/cooling rack and seal with a toothpick, if needed.\n14. Repeat these steps until you have a rack full of flautas.\n15. Give them one more teeny spritz of olive oil to get them extra crispy [no-frying! whoo!] and set the rack baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.\n16. The wire rack elevates the flautas and allows them to get nice and crispy on both sides. If you don't own a wire rack, simply place the flautas on aluminum foil after spraying and turn over halfway through cooking so both sides will get a chance to crisp up. Uber easy!\n17. Bake on the middle rack, at 425F, for 15 minutes.\n18. At the end, set to broil on HIGH for just under a minute to crisp the tortillas into a perfectly golden, crunchy shell.\n19. Pile high with any + all veggies you have on hand and serve with plain greek yogurt, salsa, and guacamole for dipping! You can even whip up a small bowl of jalapeno ranch for dunking too! If you have any fresh lime or cilantro both will make a tasty garnish!",

I prefer to roll the dough out between parchment paper since it’s easy, but you can also do it by coating the rolling pin with a little flour to prevent sticking.\n9. You can use all-purpose flour if you prefer or if that’s what you have. I like the flavor from whole-wheat, but both will work.\n10.

Make a flattened disc of dough.\n17. Roll the dough ¼-inch thick between two pieces of lightly floured pieces of parchment paper. (The flour will ensure that the cut outs are easy to move.)\n18.

These crackers are best eaten soon after they come out of the oven—they small so good I don’t know how you’d resist!—but you can store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a day or two.\n9. They start to soften as they sit, so if you’re worried about eating the whole batch, make half and store the rest of the dough in a zip-top bag in the fridge or freezer, and when ready to make more, bring the dough to room temp and bake!\n10. How to Store\n11. These crackers are best eaten on the day they’re made, but you can store them in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two.\n12. Best Tips for Success\n13. To make these gluten-free, use gluten-free flour blend and certified gluten-free rolled oats.\n14. Use the rosemary to add a little extra flavor, or omit it if you prefer. Or try garlic powder or black pepper for other flavor variations.\n15. If your dough is sticky at any point, place it into the fridge for a few minutes to firm up. If your dough seems to not come together when it’s in the food processor, add a few additional drops of milk.\n16. Set the timer for the lower end of the baking range to start, then add another minute until the edges are lightly golden brown. The edges can get very brown really fast at the end.\n17. To make a smaller batch, place half of the dough into a freezer storage bag, seal, and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature, roll out, cut out shapes, and bake whenever the urge strikes!\n18. You may also like my go-to Store-Bought Snacks.\n19. Dairy-free: Use nondairy cheese and softened coconut oil in place of the cheese and butter.\n20. Gluten-free: Use a 1:1 style of gluten-free flour blend like the one from King Arthur Flour.\n21. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.\n22. Add all ingredients to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse a few times to grind, then blend for 15-20 seconds until dough comes together.\n23. Form the dough into a disc. Dust a piece of parchment with flour, place the dough on top, and add another piece of parchment to cover.\n24. Roll out until ¼ inch thick. Cut with small cookie cutters and place on the prepared baking sheet. Re-roll and cut remaining dough until completed.\n25. (If your milk, cheese, and butter are cold the dough should be easy to roll out between parchment paper. If the dough seems too sticky, stick it into the fridge for 5-10 minutes.)\n26. Bake 14-16 minutes or until crackers are golden. Cool for a few minutes on a wire rack before serving.\n27. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 days at room temperature.",

    "instructions": "1. Here’s a look at the easy process involved in making this granola bar recipe. Scroll down to the bottom of this post for the full recipe.\n2. Add ingredients to a food processor, choosing your flavor. Grind until the mixture starts to hold together.\n3. Pour the batter onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and press flat.\n4. Score the batter with a knife, which makes them easy to break into pieces once they’re baked.\n5. Bake, let cool, and enjoy.\n6. CAN I MAKE THESE WITHOUT CHIA SEEDS?\n7. Sure! See the variation at the bottom that calls for omitting them and slightly increasing the nut butter. This keeps a good amount of healthy fats to ensure that the bars hold together and that the kids get a nicely balanced snack.\n8. CAN I MAKE THESE GLUTEN-FREE GRANOLA BARS?\n9. These bars are naturally egg-free and dairy-free. They’re also easy to make gluten-free by choosing gluten-free oats and a gluten-free flour blend.\n10. HOW LONG DO THESE HEALTHY GRANOLA BARS LAST?\n11. I store our homemade granola bars in the fridge (because I like them cold) in an airtight container and serve them up until we run out.\n12. In the fridge in an airtight container, they’ll stay fresh for about two weeks.\n13. At room temperature in an airtight container, they’ll last about 1 week.\n14. In the freezer, you can place cooled bars in a sealed zip top freezer bag for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before serving.\n15. CAN I FREEZE GRANOLA BARS?\n16. Yes, this granola bar recipe freezes really well. Simply let them cool and place into a zip top freezer bag. Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge or at room temperature, or directly in a lunchbox.\n17. Flavor Variations\n18. I’m so happy that a reader suggested this because it works so well to use a fruit or veggie puree instead of water in the original recipe! I’ve tried making Applesauce Granola Bars, Banana Granola Bars, Butternut Squash, Sweet Potato, and Pumpkin Granola Bars.\n19. Look in the Notes at the bottom of the recipe for the info.\n20. Best Tips for Success\n21. For kids under one, you can substitute brown rice syrup for the honey. You can also try using applesauce.\n22. You can make them in the basic flavor, or banana, apple, sweet potato, butternut squash, or pumpkin.\n23. To make these without coconut, omit and use additional oats.\n24. To make these without chia seeds, omit and increase the nut butter to ¼ cup.\n25. To make this without a food processor, use quick or instant oats and stir everything together. (Or grind the oats and coconut in a blender, then stir the ingredients together in a bowl)\n26. Add chocolate chips to this recipe by pressing a few into the top of the rolled out batter just before baking.\n27. Use room temperature honey and nut or seed butter to make the batter come together easily, or warm them briefly.\n28. Wet your fingers or use a piece of parchment to press the batter down if it’s sticking to your hands.\n29. You may also like No-Bake Granola Bars, Breakfast Bars, my Easy Oatmeal Bars, and my 3-Ingredient Cereal Bars.\n30. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat. Warm the honey and peanut butter for about 15 seconds if not stored at room temperature.\n31. Place the oats and coconut into the bowl of a food processor and blitz to grind into a coarse texture (similar to quick oats).\n32. Add the remaining ingredients, including the peanut butter and honey, and blend well.\n33. (You can also grind the oats or use instant oats, then mix everything together in a bowl.)\n34. Add ¼ cup water and blend until batter comes together like thick cookie dough. You should be able to press the batter together between your fingers and have it stick together. If it doesn't, add a bit more water.\n35. Place batter onto the center of the prepared baking sheet and use your hands to press thin, about ¼-½-inch thick and about 8x8-inches big. I measure roughly using an 8x8-inch baking pan. (You can also roll out the dough—just cover it with a piece of parchment paper first to make sure it's easy to do.) Use a knife to lightly score lines for squares in whatever size you like.\n36. Bake for 18-20 minutes, remove from oven, and let cool completely on the pan.\n37. Break into squares and serve.\n38. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks in the fridge or a week at room temperature. To freeze, place cooled bars in a sealed zip top freezer bag for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before serving.",

The main thing to know ahead of time is that you’ll want to reserve a little of the pasta cooking water before you drain the pasta. You’ll use that to help thin the zucchini sauce.\n2. AD\n3. Cook the pasta, reserving a little of the pasta cooking water. Meanwhile, Slice your zucchini and mince the garlic.\n4. Sautee until cooked through and lightly golden brown.\n5. Add to a blender with the remaining sauce ingredients, including a little bit of reserved cooking water.\n6. Blend smooth.\n7. How to Store\n8. Store any remaining sauce in airtight containers in the fridge for up to 5 days. Or freeze in an ice cube tray overnight, transfer to a freezer bag, remove as much air as you can and freeze for up to 6 months.\n9. Thaw 1-2 cubes overnight in the fridge in a container or at room temperature for about an hour and add to servings of pasta for easy meals.\n10. Best Tips for Success\n11. Trade in shallot or onion for the garlic if you like.\n12. Use yellow summer squash if desired.\n13. Add a few basil, spinach, or parsley leaves to enhance the green color.\n14. Use any type of pasta you like, including regular, whole-wheat, or a bean-based pasta (which would be an easy way to add more iron to this meal).\n15. If the kids don’t love sauce on their pasta, you can offer a small amount of the sauce with buttered pasta as shown above.\n16. Reserve a little of the pasta cooking water to help thin the sauce as you blend it up.\n17. Top with extra Parmesan, lemon, and black pepper as you like.\n18. AD\n19. Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Before draining, remove and reserve one cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain and set aside.\n20. Meanwhile, cut the ends off of the zucchini and discard. Slice the zucchini about ¼-inch thick.\n21. Add the olive oil to a medium skillet over medium heat. When warm, add the garlic. Toss to coat with the oil. Cook for 2 minutes, or until fragrant.\n22. Add the zucchini and stir to coat with the oil. Cover and cook for 10-12 minutes, turning once or twice, or until the zucchini is very soft when poked with a fork. Remove from heat and let cool slightly for a few minutes.\n23. Transfer the zucchini to a blender, adding the beans and optional herb or spinach. (That additional makes this a brighter green color.) Blend, starting slowly and working up to high. Add the pasta cooking water, ¼-cup at a time, to make a smooth sauce.\n24. Add ½ of the sauce to the pasta and stir to combine. Add as much additional sauce as you like or store the remaining sauce for future use. Serve with Parmesan, lemon zest, and/or pepper as desired.",

    "instructions": "1. This sauce comes together quickly once you get started, so measure the dry ingredients (the flour, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt and optional cinnamon) into a small bowl and place it near the stove. Place the tomato paste and broth near the stove as well.\n2. In a medium-sized pot over medium heat, warm the oil until it’s hot enough that a light sprinkle of the flour/spice mixture sizzles on contact. This might take a couple of minutes, so be patient and don’t step away from the stove!\n3. Once it’s ready, pour in the flour and spice mixture. While whisking constantly, cook until fragrant and slightly deepened in color, about 1 minute. Whisk the tomato paste into the mixture, then slowly pour in the broth while whisking constantly to remove any lumps.\n4. Raise heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, whisking often, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened a bit and a spoon encounters some resistance as you stir it. (The sauce will thicken some more as it cools.)\n5. Remove from heat, then whisk in the vinegar and season to taste with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Add more salt, if necessary (I usually add another pinch or two). Go forth and make enchiladas!\n6. STORAGE SUGGESTIONS: Extra enchilada sauce will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Or, freeze it for up to 3 months. Let it cool to room temperature before transferring to a wide-mouth mason jar, leaving some room at the top for expansion (don’t screw on the lid completely until the mixture is fully frozen), or a freezer bag (remove excess air before sealing).",

With a base recipe that bakes up perfectly fluffy and just-sweet-enough muffins, and 6 options to add flavors from fruit, veggies, spices, and chocolate chips, this Yogurt Muffin recipe is as versatile as it is delicious!\n2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 12-cup standard muffin pan with nonstick spray.\n3. In a medium bowl, stir together the flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.\n4. In another bowl, stir together the yogurt, maple syrup, butter, eggs, and vanilla.\n5. Gently stir the yogurt mixture into the flour mixture. (Expect the batter to be thick.)\n6. Add your desired add-in. (You can also add 1 tablespoon of any add-in to each muffin cup, using ¼ cup batter, to make a batch with a few different flavors. Or you can bake them plain.) Stir gently to combine.\n7. Divide batter among the prepared muffin tin, using about ¼ cup batter in each cup.\n8. Bake for 16-18 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from oven, then transfer muffins to a wire rack to cool fully.\n9. Top with butter, nut butter, or jam as desired.",

Chop the salad bar vegetables into very small pieces, then divide them evenly among the pizzas.

Cover the baking sheets with plastic wrap and freeze for about 8 hours, or until the pizzas are solid.\n5. Once the pizzas are frozen solid, carefully transfer them to a gallon sized freezer bag for long term storage (you may need two bags). For the best results, the pizzas should be cooked and eaten within 3 months.\n6. To bake the pizzas, take out the number you wish to bake, place them on a baking sheet, and let them partially thaw as you preheat the oven to 400ºF (about 7 minutes). Once the oven is fully preheated, bake the pizzas for about 15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the cheese is melted. Baking time will vary depending on your oven and the amount of toppings on the pizzas.",

Stir well for a few minutes until all the ingredients are incorporated.\n7. Add in the pasta (4-5 cups)\n8. Hit cancel on the IP and switch it to Pressure Cook on High Mode. Cut the cooking time on the box in half for the pressure cook time (box said 6 minutes to al dente- so I cooked the pasta for 3 minutes).\n9. After it cooks, immediately do a quick release.\n10. The consistency should be soupy.\n11. If it is too thick- add water in one cup increments until you reach the desired consistency.\n12. If your pasta is undercooked- just set it on saute mode and let it simmer until the pasta cooks.\n13. Add in the mozzarella. No additional salt needed.",

Mix in all of the ingredients, except the Eno fruit salt – gram flour, semolina, turmeric, salt, sugar, green chili, ginger, lime juice, oil and water. Stir to combine well and let the batter sit for 15 minutes.\n3. While the batter is resting, boil 2 cups water in the pressure cooker on sauté mode. Also, grease the steel pan in which you will make the khaman with oil. I used one container from the stackable steel containers for the instant pot.\n4. After 15 minutes, add Eno to the batter and stir it gently in one direction. The batter will become frothy and increase in volume. Do not over stir.\n5. Quickly transfer the batter to the greased steel container and place the container on a trivet. It is important to start cooking quickly after adding Eno to get soft and fluffy Khaman.\n6. Steaming in Instant Pot\n7. Then place the trivet along with the pan in the instant pot. Set to Steam mode for 15 mins in venting mode. The instant pot timer does not work in venting mode, hence you will need to set an external timer.\n8. After the cooking time is done, let the khaman sit for 5 minutes. Then open the lid of the instant pot and take out the khaman using tongs.\n9. Let it cool for 5 more minutes, so it is easy to remove. Insert a knife or toothpick to check it is cooked. The knife should come out almost clean. If not, you will need to steam for 2-3 more minutes.\n10. Run a knife around the edges of the khaman. Place a plate on top of the container and turn it upside down. This will help to get the khaman out of the container easily.\n11. Prepare Tempering\n12. While the khaman is steaming in the instant pot, heart oil in a pan on stovetop on high heat.\n13. Then add the mustard seeds and let them sizzle. Now add the curry leaves. Let them sauté for about 30 seconds. Add the sesame seeds and turn off heat.\n14. Now add water, sugar, salt and stir well.\n15. Cut the khaman into small pieces. Spread the tempering over it.\n16.

Chilling is required for this sticky cookie dough.\n7. Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator.\n8. Preheat the oven to 350℉. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Let the cookie dough rest for 10 minutes. This helps to prevent too much spread.\n9. Place the sugar in one bowl and the powdered sugar in another bowl. Use a small cookie scoop (1 oz or 1 Tablespoon) and scoop the dough. Place 12 cookie dough balls per cookie sheet.\n10. Roll the cookie dough ball in the sugar first. Then, roll in the powdered sugar. Make sure it has a thick coat of powdered sugar.\n11. Once all rolled, bake for 11-13 minutes. Bake until the edges are set. Make sure to not over bake these, otherwise they will be dry and the powdered sugar will melt.\n12. Cool the cookies on the hot pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.",

It’s a hefty pinwheel, so just scrape it aside and move along.\n4. Starting in the center of the tortilla, use your hands to form and tighten the roll, moving outward toward the edges. This will help the fillings form together and make slicing easier.\n5. Use a serrated knife (blunt-edge knives may smash the pinwheel), and slice into 1/2-inch slices – about 8-10.\n6.

Pour 1.5 cups of the hot water on top of the sabudana and let it sit for 30 minutes.\n5. After 30 minutes, press a few of the sabudana between your fingers- they should be soft.\n6. Drain the sabudana , rinse with cold water and transfer the sabudana to a wide colander or spread out in a large pan until the sabudana is completely dry (about 15-20 minutes).\n7. Directions\n8. In a large pot, heat the oil over medium high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and scallion whites and stir.\n9. Next add the bell peppers, turmeric, chili powder, taco seasoning and cook on low heat until the bell peppers are soft.\n10. Once the peppers are soft, add the garlic and salt.\n11. Add the sabudana, cilantro, lime juice, green scallions and mix until everything is well combined.I like my sabudana a little sticky and more soft so I cook it for an additional 5-6 minutes until I get that texture.\n12.

Place the filled steamer plates into the steamer and steam for 10 minutes on high heat. Once steamed, turn off the heat and keep aside and allow it to cool.\n6. Once the cooled, transfer to a large mixing bowl and crumble the steamed paruppu - this mixture is called the paruppu usili (crumbled dal). Keep this aside.\n7. The next step is to cook the green beans.\n8. In a pressure cooker, add the chopped green beans along with 2 tablespoons of water. Sprinkle in a little salt.\n9. Pressure cook the green beans for 2 whistles on high heat, turn off the heat and run the pressure cooker under water to release pressure immediately. The beans will be cooked perfectly without loss of colour and nutrition.\n10. Place a wok or kadai on medium heat and add a teaspoon of oil. Once the oil is hot, add mustard seeds and urad dal and allow it to crackle and the dal to turn golden brown.\n11. After the seeds have crackled, add asafoetida, the curry leaves and the steamed paruppu usili and mix thoroughly.\n12. Saute the dal in the oil for a good 3 to 4 minutes until it gets a perfect crumbly texture. Once you have a good texture, stir in the green beans and turn off the heat. Check the salt and adjust to taste accordingly.\n13. Serve with Vathal Kuzhambu Recipe and Rice for a weekday meal.",

Preheat the oven and line baking sheets with parchment paper for easy cleanup. Place the tortillas onto baking sheets. Top with pizza sauce, mozzarella, Parmesan, and any desired toppings.\n3. Bake until warmed through and the cheese is just golden brown. Serve warm, slicing into wedges so it’s easy to eat.\n4. How to Store\n5. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat on a plate in the microwave for 30 seconds or heat through in a 375-degree-F oven.\n6. Best Tips for Success\n7. Use any type of tortilla you prefer. I usually use fajita-size whole wheat or regular flour ones, but the method is versatile.\n8. Use dairy-free cheese as needed.\n9. Serve with simple sides such as fruit, applesauce, salad, or roasted broccoli.\n10. Fold the pizza in half to serve like a pizza quesadilla.\n11. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\n12. Place the tortillas onto 2 rimmed baking sheets. Top each with pizza sauce, spreading just to the edges, and the mozzarella, Parmesan, and any desired toppings.\n13. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until warmed through and the cheese is just golden brown.\n14. Serve warm, slicing up into wedges.",

Slice the green onions; reserve the dark green portions for a garnish.\n4. Dice the onion and carrots.\n5. In a very large skillet, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and white and light green portions of the green onions and sauté until translucent, about 3 minutes, then add the carrots and sauté for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and sauté for 2 minutes.\n6. Add the quinoa and salt and stir to combine.\n7. Make a well in the quinoa, exposing the pan, and crack the eggs into the pan.\n8. Scramble the eggs and cook for several minutes until they are soft, then stir them into the quinoa (resist the urge to stir them into the quinoa until they are cooked). Add the baby greens and continue to stir until they are fully wilted, about 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, stir in the soy sauce and green onion tops and mix. Taste and add additional salt as desired (we added an additional ¼ teaspoon as our soy sauce was low sodium).\n9. If desired, drizzle with sriracha and/or additional soy sauce.

To assemble each burrito, layer refried beans in the centre of the tortilla (about ⅓ cup per burrito), about ¼ cup of cooked rice on top, ½ of pepper mixture, a few slices of avocado and about 2 tablespoons of crumbled cheese per burrito.\n5. To fold the burritos: For each one, bring one side of the tortilla up over the ingredients (covering them), fold in each side, then begin to tightly roll the burrito (keeping everything tucked in as you roll, so it's compact). Alternatively, you can fold the burrito your favourite way. Serve and enjoy! This burrito is delicious served with your favourite chips and salsa (or enjoy the burrito as is).\n6. Optional (but delicious): Wipe out the frying pan and lightly grease with vegetable oil. Place over medium heat. Add burritos to the pan and warm for about 2 minutes per side.",

These are not super sweet, so add up to ¼ cup sugar to the batter if desired.\n11. Use honey instead of maple syrup if needed.\n12. Use almond butter or sunflower seed butter instead of the peanut butter.\n13. Use a gluten-free cup for cup flour blend instead of all purpose if desired.\n14. Make them nut-free with sunflower seed butter.\n15. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease an 8×8-inch pan with nonstick spray.\n16. Add the chickpeas to a colander to drain. Rinse with water. Drain.\n17. Add to a food processor with the banana, peanut butter, maple syrup, vanilla, salt, and baking soda. Grind on high to make a uniformly smooth batter. (It might take 15-30 seconds.)\n18.

You could always add them to this recipe or you could try this cookie recipe here.\n3. Cream all of the ingredients together.\n4. To make this cookie recipe: simply mix sugars, softened butter and egg together in medium bowl. (Remember, my favorite bowl is no more. I still mourn the loss.)\n5. Then mix in the dry ingredients. Stir well and put on cookie sheet (ungreased).\n6. Then bake and serve. Delicious and easy!\n7. Yes, you do. Too little or too much of the brown sugar will drastically result in cookies that don't turn out right. Be sure to measure the brown sugar carefully.\n8. I would cook them for 12-15 minutes and go from there.\n9. Wait! 365 degrees? Why?\n10. Good question! I found that one of the secrets to these cookies is 365 degrees is the perfect. 375 degrees is too high and 350 degrees is too low.\n11. I personally think this cookie recipe is the best for soft and chewy cookies and I urge you to try it.\n12. You will probably never use another cookie recipe again.\n13.

    "instructions": "1. Toast the tortillas on each side in a dry skillet over medium-low heat until they are a slightly stiff and have browned just a bit on the edges. Stack them on a plate until ready to use. Toasting the tortillas increases the flavor and helps prevent them from cracking. Shred an 8oz. block of pepper jack cheese. Half will be used for the enchilada filling and half will be used for the sauce.\n2. Defrost the frozen spinach in a microwave or take it out of the freezer before beginning to allow it time to defrost naturally. Squeeze as much moisture out of the thawed spinach as possible. Place the spinach in a large bowl. Rinse and drain the white beans, then add them to the bowl with the spinach. Also add 4oz. of the shredded cheese, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and a little freshly cracked pepper. Stir until the mixture is evenly combined.\n3. Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Begin preparing the pepper jack sauce by adding the butter and minced garlic to a small sauce pot. Sauté the garlic in the butter for one minute over medium heat. Add the milk and cream cheese to the pot. Stir and heat until the cream cheese has fully melted into the milk and the mixture has thickened slightly. Season with salt. Begin adding the remaining shredded pepper jack, a handful at a time, and stirring it in until fully melted before adding more. Once all the cheese has been melted into the sauce, turn the heat off and allow it to cool slightly.\n4. Coat the inside of a casserole dish with non-stick spray. Begin filling the toasted tortillas with the spinach and white bean mixture and rolling them closed. Line up the filled tortillas in the casserole dish, seam sides facing down. Choose a casserole dish that fits 12 of the rolled enchiladas snugly to help keep them from unrolling.\n5. Once the tortillas are filled and in the casserole dish, pour the pepper jack sauce over top. Bake the enchiladas in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the edges of the tortillas are brown and the pepper jack sauce is thick and browned on the edges. Sprinkle chopped cilantro over top, if desired.",

    "instructions": "1. To Drain the Tofu\n2. Wrap 1 package extra firm tofu with a paper towel and place it on a tray/plate. Put another tray/plate on top of the tofu and press it down with a heavy object for roughly 30 minutes to 1 hour. (I pressed for 2 hours this time; my single tofu block weighed 400 g before pressing and 355 g after.) If you‘re in a hurry, you can microwave the tofu without plastic wrap for 1½ minutes (at 1000 watts) and drain the water.\n3. To Mix the Seasonings\n4. While you're waiting for the tofu to drain, mix the seasonings. In a small bowl, add 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 tsp toasted sesame oil, 1 Tbsp miso, 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and ⅛ tsp white pepper powder.\n5. Whisk it all together and set aside.\n6. To Make the Filling\n7. Discard the tough core of 2–3 leaves cabbage (green). Cut the leaves into julienned pieces.\n8. Mince the julienned cabbage into small pieces. Tip: It‘s usually easier to tuck smaller pieces in the gyoza wrapper rather than chunkier pieces.\n9. Repeat with ⅛ head red cabbage: Discard the tough core of the red cabbage leaves and cut the leaves into julienned pieces. Then, mince into small pieces.\n10. Put the minced green and red cabbage in a bowl and add 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt. Rub the salt into the cabbage with your hands and set aside until it releases its liquid.\n11. Cut 2 inches carrot into slabs, then sticks, and mince them.\n12. Mince ½ onion finely: Lay the onion flat side down on the cutting board. With the knife tip pointing toward the root end, make ⅛-inch vertical slices to within ½ inch of the root end. Then, with the knife edge toward the root end, make ⅛-inch horizontal slices, again keeping the root intact. Finally, make perpendicular cuts down through the vertical slices you made.\n13. Cut 2 green onions/scallions into white and green parts. Save the green part for garnish. Mince the white part into small pieces for the filling.\n14. Cut off and discard the root end of 4 king oyster mushrooms (eringi). Cut the mushrooms into sticks and then mince them.\n15. Discard the stems of 2 shiitake mushrooms. Cut the mushroom caps into strips, and then mince them.\n16. To a large bowl, add the onion, two kinds of mushrooms, carrots, and white part of the green onions. Then, mince or press 1 clove garlic (I use my garlic press here) and add it to the bowl.\n17. Peel and grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater ). Measure 1 tsp ginger (grated, with juice) and add it to the filling ingredients.\n18. Squeeze and discard the liquid from the cabbage. Add the cabbage to the bowl with the other ingredients.\n19. Remove the paper towel and slice the tofu into thin slabs roughly ⅛ inch (3 mm) thickness (pencil width).\n20. Next, cut the tofu slabs into sticks, and then cut the sticks into cubes.\n21. Add the tofu cubes and the seasonings mixture to the bowl. Mix it all together. Once the ingredients are well coated with the seasonings, add 2 Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch and mix thoroughly. If the filling seems watery, add more potato starch to absorb any extra moisture.\n22. To Fold the Gyoza\n23. Prepare a tray or plate with parchment paper and sprinkle some potato starch (cornstarch). This will prevent the gyoza from sticking to the paper. Gather 80 gyoza wrappers and prepare a small bowl of water.\n24. Take a wrapper and place it in the palm of your non-dominant hand. Use a teaspoon to scoop a small amount of filling and put it in the center of the wrapper. Dip one finger in the bowl of water and draw a circle around the outer ¼ inch (6 mm) of the wrapper with your wet finger until it’s moistened all around.\n25. Here, I show you how to fold the gyoza with the pleats leaning toward the center. Fold the wrapper in half over the filling and pinch it in the center with your fingers, but don’t seal it yet. Using the thumb and index finger of your right hand, start making a pleat about every ¼ inch (6 mm) on the top part of the wrapper from the center toward the right side, making 3–4 pleats.\n26. As you fold each pleat, press the folded pleat tightly against the back part of the wrapper using your other thumb and index finger. Make 3–4 pleats.\n27. Continue with the left side of the gyoza. Making 3–4 pleats with your left hand, starting in the center and moving toward the left side.\n28. Press the pleats tightly, making sure there are no air pockets. Shape the gyoza to look pretty. Repeat folding the remaining wrappers. Tip: See my Gyoza recipe for an alternative folding method where the pleats all lean toward one side.\n29. To Freeze Uncooked (optional)\n30. This recipe may make more gyoza than you wish to serve now. If you want to store some uncooked gyoza to cook later (optional), now is the time to freeze them. Before the filling starts to release moisture and make the wrappers soggy, cover the gyoza with plastic wrap and “flash freeze” them in the freezer until solid (or at least frozen on the outside). Make sure to lay out the gyoza in a single layer on a sheet pan or plate. Once the gyoza are solid, pack them in an airtight bag. Because you flash froze them, the gyoza won’t stick to each other in the bag. You can store the gyoza in the freezer for up to a month. When you‘re ready to use the gyoza, do not defrost them. Place the frozen gyoza in your frying pan and steam them for an extra 1–2 minutes.\n31. To Cook the Gyoza\n32. To cook the gyoza that you just folded, heat a large nonstick frying pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil. Then, place the gyoza in a single layer, flat side down and without touching each other, in a circular pattern (or place them in two rows). You will need to cook the gyoza in batches. As you can see from the photo, my large frying pan can fit about 12–13 pieces per batch.\n33. Cook until the bottoms of the gyoza turn golden brown, about 3 minutes. Next, add ¼ cup water to the pan.\n34. Immediately cover with a lid and steam the gyoza for about 3 minutes or until most of the water evaporates. Tip: If you‘re cooking frozen gyoza, steam them for an extra 1–2 minutes.\n35. Remove the lid to evaporate any remaining water. Drizzle 1 tsp toasted sesame oil around the gyoza in the frying pan. Cook, uncovered, until the bottom of the gyoza are golden brown and crisp.\n36. To Serve:\n37. Transfer the cooked gyoza to a plate. Repeat the process to cook the other batches. Serve the Vegetable Gyoza with a small bowl of dipping sauce for each person. To make the dipping sauce, combine 1 Tbsp rice vinegar (unseasoned), 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and ⅛ tsp la-yu (Japanese chili oil) in each dipping bowl and mix it all together.\n38. Cut the green part of a green onion for garnish, if you‘d like.\n39. To Store:\n40. You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for a month.",

You can make a big batch of this on the weekend and store it in the fridge until you are ready to use it during the week, which is what I like to do when I’m on top of my meal planning. (That only happens sometimes!) It will last up to 5 days in an airtight container like a quart-size Mason jar.\n7. You can also let it cool and store it in a freezer safe container in the freezer for at least 3 months. Let it thaw overnight in the fridge or use the defrost feature on your microwave to thaw more quickly.\n8. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the vegetables, stir, and cover. Cook for 10 minute or until mostly soft.\n9. Remove lid and stir in the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium low and place the lid so it’s mostly covering the pot but not a tight seal. This will let some steam escape but will protect your cooktop from splatters. Simmer for 20-25 minutes or until everything is soft.\n10. Puree with an immersion blender or in a regular blender. Season to taste with additional salt as needed.\n11. Serve with 1 pound of cooked pasta and Parmesan cheese, if desired.\n12. Brown ½ pound ground beef or mild Italian sausage in Step 1 after you warm the oil. Proceed as directed.\n13. To do this in a Slow Cooker:\n14. Double all ingredient amounts and add to the slow cooker. Cook on LOW for 6-8 hours or until everything is softened. Finish as directed in Step 3.\n15. To make this into Pizza Sauce: Simmer the sauce for about 30-45 minutes longer on low, stirring occasionally, or until very thick. Add 1 teaspoon pizza seasoning.\n16. Use veggies with colors like white, yellow, orange, and red that will blend together into a classic looking tomato sauce when combined with the canned tomatoes.\n17. Double the recipe to make more and freeze the second half of the batch for a future week.\n18. Use the same volume of diced fresh tomatoes, just simmer longer to allow the extra liquid to evaporate.\n19. Serve with a pound of whichever kind of pasta your family prefers.\n20. Add some protein to the pasta and sauce by adding canned white beans or chickpeas, warmed frozen peas, diced cooked chicken breast, meatballs, or even lentils.",
